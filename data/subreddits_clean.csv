nfl,1,hvxd1n,0,2020-07-22 10:53:40,10,1,"How a World Cup Style Season could work for the NFL this year. 8 Divisions, Round Robin. 6 game regular season, 16 Team Playoff. I want football just as much as anyone else reading this post on new.

I have an idea that could work if things get to the point of changing the schedule beyond non conference games.

If teams only play their own division the risk slightly goes down.

So proposal would be each division plays 6 games vs their own division the top 2 seeds from each division would advance. Based on W/L Then H/H for direct ties, then Point Differential for 3rd tiebreaker, then away wins for 4th tie break.

The teams would play 1 home 1 away vs each division opponent like they do now.

From there the top seed in each division would get a slot, and they would play the 2 seed from their respective opponent. 

Tourney style all the way to the Superbowl.


While this obviously won't happen, what would your thoughts on this be?

nfl,4,hvx8z0,1,2020-07-22 10:47:38,10,1,"2020 Offseason Review Series - The Carolina Panthers #Team: The Carolina Panthers

**Division:** The NFC South

**2019 Record:** 5-11

> *”Biggest thing; missed opportunities. We had a chance to put points on the board. We didn’t do it...we had some missed opportunities to keep them backed up as far as defense is concerned, but we let them out. Couple things happened and it was a missed opportunity.”*

> - Ron Rivera

To call our 2019 season something of an up and down affair is to put things mildly. Things got off to a damn disappointing start when Cam injured his Lisfranc in our preseason outing against the Patriots (and you cannot convince me that Bill Belichick didn’t 4D Chess that shit) and started the year playing like absolute crap. Yet after going on the IR, we initially took a big step forward. Under quarterback ~~Christian McCaffery~~ Kyle Allen, the team won 5 of 6 games in a row...before plummeting back to earth like the Hindenburg and losing out the rest of the year. It wasn’t just the offense that was bad (that was to be expected with Cam missing the season). The defense was also a complete tire fire.


What followed has been little less than the Phoenix bursting into flames and disintegrating to ash. This is my fifth offseason review for my beloved Panthers and this year more than any other, we have emerged from the offseason as a totally different team than whence we entered. Even after the Fox regime met its demise, the roster was relatively intact at the end. So, let's dive into the most dramatic Panthers offseason the franchise has maybe ever seen.

#Coaching Changes

> *”The death of a dream can in fact serve as the vehicle that endows it with new form, with reinvigorated substance, a fresh flow of ideas, and splendidly revitalized color.”*

> - Aberjhani

 After nearly 9 years in Carolina, Ron Rivera was fired after a loss to Washington on December 3rd. The move wasn’t unexpected. It was no secret that Carolina’s winningest coach entered this year on the hot seat, and despite the early success without Cam, it was clear that our atrocious close to the season had done him in. Though fans fairly unanimously agree with his firing, I think it’s fair to say that the ultimate cause of his demise were Cam’s back to back injuries and an owner that wanted to remake the team in his own image. None of this is to say that he didn’t deserve it. It was time for all sides to move on. But one certainly can’t accuse his legacy here of being one of failure.

Regardless, the team scored the coaching hire of the offseason when it landed vaunted Temple and Baylor coach **Matt Rhule**. Rhule is no stranger to rebuilds. After leaving Temple a more respectable program than he inherited, he went on to lead a full blown rebuild at Baylor. Decimanted by a sexual assault scandal and left the rump of the NCAA recruiting world, the program was a shadow of its former self. But Rhule thrived there, taking the program from 1-11 his first season to 11-1 his third; a remarkable turnaround that made him the belle of the NFL coaching ball going into 2020.
When you strip aside the platitudes about his leadership and process, (qualities I have no doubt served him well on his road here, but are ultimately untested at the pro level) Rhule is an aggressive, offensive minded coach who believes in controlling games through the run that leans heavily on zone blocking schemes and run pass options.

Augmenting Rhule’s offensive minded regime, Rhule tapped LSU passing guru **Joe Brady** to be our new offensive coordinator. Pain me though it does to admit this, Brady learned under the best as an offensive assistant for Sean Payton’s Saints, and put that education to work when he galvanized LSU’s passing game. His scheme was instrumental not just in turning Joe Burrow into the number one pick in the 2020 draft, but also helped make Clyde Edwards-Helaire into a first round pick. His passing attack in 2019 was historically effective, which bodes well for the slate of weapons he’s inheriting in Carolina.

Neither coach had the years to implement their schemes that are typical of college regimes, so the exact nature of our offense is somewhat mysterious. Both Brady and Rhule favor aggressive offenses that lean heavily on the run game, and utilizing running backs in run pass options. I have little doubt that Christian McCaffery will remain the centerpiece of our offense or that he was one of the chief allures to both coaches. But Brady also emphasized using weapons in space and attacking downfield, which bodes well for weapons like Curtis Samuel, Robby Anderson and DJ Moore.

It’s an exciting lineup for a team that has spent years mired in a defense first, ball control philosophy for the last several years. But the team’s offense isn’t the old side of the ball getting a makeover. To lead our “rebuilt” defense, Rhule hired his longtime defensive coordinator **Phile Snow**. I have less to say about this hire other than that his teams are known for ball hawking and going after the passer. 

For reasons which will soon be obvious, I don’t think most of us expect much from Snow his first year. But the new coaching class represents something of a sea change in Carolina’s philosophy, which between Rivera and Fox before him was predominantly conservative. The hirings are not without risk. None of these men have a great deal of experience leading NFL teams. But after watching the success of a guy like Kliff Kingsbury in Carolina, the youth and fresh ideas of the Rhule/Brady regime is a welcome breath of fresh air.

These hires were ultimately met with a ton of excitement from fans, starting our offseason off on a relative high note. But for the Carolina faithful, that optimism would prove to be short lived. Because almost immediately after these exciting new hires, the offseason went very, very south very, very quickly.

#Departures

> *”Well, that's great. That's just fuckin' great, man! Now what the fuck are we supposed to do? We're in some real pretty shit now, man! Game over, man. Game over.”*

> - Bill Paxton, *Aliens*

It’s pretty safe to say that the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand Twenty has been less than warmly received by pretty much everyone so far. And for Panthers fans, the bad news began early when, on January 14th, perennial All Pro and Hall of Fame caliber **linebacker Luke Kuechly announced his retirement.** Shocking as the move initially was, it shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise. Luke has battled a nasty string of concussions. He’s a smart, film savvy enough guy that a less health threatening position in pro scouting or coaching was always in the cards. At 29, his fabulous career as a player is at an end, and predictably has already joined our scouting team. 

From a football standpoint, the loss this represents cannot be overstated. Luke was not only the best defense player on our team, but one of the best defenders in the League. It was a titanic loss for a team that was reeling on defense to begin with, and his production will doubtlessly prove irreplaceable. Luke wasn’t just a smart linebacker who could close space with a speed somewhat akin to teleportation, but an on field general of sorts. The testimony of players who faced off with him to this effect is nearly endless, but his ability to diagnose plays and redirect our players turned him into something of a second coach, and helped mask numerous deficiencies in our roster for years. Linebackers can be replaced. That kind of defensive genius cannot.

It is impossible to know if the rest of our offseason would have played out the same way had Luke not hung them up. But it kicked off an offseason of painful bloodletting that almost all of our roster stalwarts and veteran talent purged. On January 30th, it was the turn of **Tight End Greg Olsen**, who despite a spate of reason injuries, played well in 2019 and was for years our only reliable receiving option. Third down savant and **Slot Receiver Jarius Wright** was released on February 25th. Nine days later, five time Pro Bowl **Guard Trai Turner** was shipped off to the Chargers in a trade we shall shortly revisit. Long tenured **Safety and Special Teamer Colin Jones** services were ended on March 16th, and on March 18th **Safety Eric Reid** was let go.

It was always known that our free agency would be rough. We were a cap strapped team in 2020 with a lot of players hitting free agency. But there was barely an attempt made to retain anyone. There was a wholesale purge of our **DTs**; **Vernon Butler** is now a Bill, **Dontari Poe** and **Gerald McCoy** are now Cowboys, and **Kyle Love** isn't anything. The edge wasn’t spared either. **DE Mario Addison**, our most consistent and talented pass rusher over our last several seasons, **Wes Horton** and pleasant free agent surprise **Bruce Irvine** all left for greener pastures. 2017 All Pro **OT turned G Daryl Williams** joined Bulter on the Bills and starting **G Greg Van Roten** has taken his remarkably solid services to the New York Jets. But our biggest loss was in free agency was **CB James Bradberry**. Our only consistently competent corner since Josh Norman left, Bradberry predictably signed with the Giants. I’m not going to argue that Bradberry was a great corner. I wouldn’t have paid him the contract he got. But between his departure and Reid’s, our secondary is badly undermanned.

When the dust settled, the net loss was three offensive starters, including two of our five offensive linemen (both on the interior). Seven out of our eleven defensive starters are gone, including everyone in the secondary but Tre Boston and Donte Jackson and our entire front seven save for Kawaan Short and Shaq Thompson.

And yet as bad as that all felt, the biggest asteroid crashed into our roster on March 17th, when OPOTY, 3 time Pro Bowl, former ROTY and 2015 NFL MVP **QB Cam Newton** was released from the team.

Need I really say any more? For 9 years, Cam was the heart and soul of the Carolina Panthers; our team leader, our biggest cheerleader, the center of gravity around which all enthusiasm for the team revolved. Our organization made him the alpha and omega of our offense for years, giving him lackluster weapons awful protection and over the hill runners to work with, knowing that his arm, his rushing ability and his football IQ could just make up for the difference to provide a competent offense. For much of his time here, Cam and Olsen headlined an offense roster of nobodies that could somehow turn electric at the drop of the hat just on the strength of Cam’s playmaking brilliance. Though he was initially considered selfish, he evolved over his tenure into a fantastic team leader and a pillar of the community that any franchise would be proud to make its face.

That era, which could in turns be fun and frustrating, futile and electric, harrowing and humiliating, is at an end. Cam took a team that was utterly rudderless and made them exciting again. To say that he’ll be missed is an understatement of tremendous magnitude, and in allowing him to depart for nothing, the Panthers left fans with a bitter pill to swallow.

He was a real one. And he will be missed.

#Arrivals

> *The song is ended, but the melody lingers on*

> *The night was splendid, but I found at the break of dawn*

> *That you and the song were gone, but the melody lingers on*

> - Sam Cooke

So, our franchise QB, franchise defender, most of our defensive starters, half our OL and one of our best franchise receivers have left the building. It was a rough free agency period, to be sure, but football did not end for the Carolina Panthers in Q1 2020 and the coaches have acquired some players with whom they must now pick up the pieces.

Headlining these is new **QB Teddy Bridgewater**, who we actually signed *before* cutting Newton. In a lot of ways, Teddy is the antithesis of his predecessor. Where Cam was inaccurate but electric, Bridgewater is accurate, but conservative. Where Cam was a playmaker with his legs, Bridgewater (never much of a runner to begin with) is almost statuesque since his knee injury.

I’ll be very honest here; I don’t think a lot of this signing. While I’m certainly going to give him a chance, I think Teddy is a solid but unspectacular QB who is either made or broken by the talent and scheme around him. We didn’t sign a franchise QB here; we overpaid for a player coming off his best season with an outstanding supporting cast. Luckily, he’s landing in a spot where he has a ton of offensive talent, as well as offensive minded coaches to guide him, but I think he will be carried by it rather than elevating it in his own right. This is a bridge, not a solution, and the QB will question in the long term remains to be answered.

Joining him on offense is **WR Robby Anderson** signed fresh from the New York Jets. And this was a shrewd and underrating signing. DJ Moore enjoyed something of a quiet breakout last year, and Samuel remains a solid-if-underutilized deep threat. What they really lacked was a third complementary piece, and while Robby left a lot to be desired as the Jets’ WR1, as our WR3, he represents a terrific compliment.

To replace James Bradberry, we signed **CB Eli Apple**. Now, on the surface, this seems like a massive downgrade, but that’s only because it is. Apple has been a disappointment since his high draft position with the Giants, and while he did bounce back a little bit with the Saints, he’s still nobody’s idea of a good starting option. He’ll enter as our CB1, Gods save us, and will remain there until our youth develops enough to replace him.

Remember how we traded Trai Turner? We got **OT Russel Okung** and a whole truckload of ridicule in return. The Okung trade was panned by pretty much everyone, but I don’t hate it now quite as much as I did at the time. Yes we traded to get older, but LT has been a point of desperate weakness since Michael Oher’s career ending concussion, and Okung is still a damn good player at the position. While the trade has left us in pitiful shape at guard, guards are comparatively easy to replace. If he plays well, we’ll have first rights to retain his services next year, and Rhule’s system, Brady’s offense and Bridgewater’s productivity are all completely dependent on good pass protection. All in all, I like the pickup.

He wasn’t our only OT signing. **RG John Miller** joins us from Cincinnati and **LG Michael Scofield** from Los Angeles. And they’re….fine. Just, y’know just...fine. I am inherently skeptical of any Bengals or Chargers cast off given their historically shitty OLs this last season. But we’re thin enough at Guard that I’m sure they’ll both be starters. Wahoo. 

And that’s pretty much it for our big name acquisitions. **Safety Justin Burris** has a real shot to start alongside Tre Boston, and was quietly very good for the Browns last year. **LB Tahir Whitehead** adds some veteran leadership and depth, but is pretty unspectacular. **TE Seth DeValve** and **WR Seth Roberts** both add a little depth at their respective positions. **WR Pharoah Cooper** was almost exclusively signed to be a return man, and while he’s never quite lived up to his 2017 season in that capacity, he’s better than any of our shitheel returners over the last 10 years. Everyone else is a depth signing so deep it scarcely bares mentioning, but one does bare mentioning. **QB PJ Walker** was signed from the XFL, which is neat because he was really really good there. He also comes from a Matt Rhule system at Temple. It’s a potentially intriguing signing that adds an element of mystery to our QB room, though I doubt anything of consequence comes from it.

#Draft


After a fee agency period that was something akin to emotional waterboarding, this was a fanbase that badly needed a lift from the draft. What we got was an NFL first all defensive draft. And despite how unsexy that sounds, it was kind of the shot in the arm a lot of us needed. Because the Panthers had a really good one. Entering the draft, our primary defense needs were “Yes”, so it made sense to focus our fire there. And while I’m somewhat disappointed that we didn’t address the OL, 

**Round 1, No. 7 overall: DT Derrick Brown, Auburn** - A lot of folks were screaming at us to take Simmons here, but Brown was an obvious choice. The Carolina Panthers allowed a League worst 5.3 YPC to running backs last year, which was the culmination of a downward trend that began with Star Lotulelei’s departure to Buffalo back in 2018. Brown was a dominant run defender in college who can fill the role as the space eating DT we so desperately need and is athletic enough to apply pressure. I love this pick.

**Round 2, No. 38 overall: Yetur Gross-Matos, DE, Penn State** - YGM represents a terrific value in the second, as many had him at a first round grade. An edge rusher and run defender, he fits the classic mold of a 4-3 DE and will make an intriguing pairing with last year’s 1st round pick Brian Burns. I expect him to step into the void right away and assume an early role.

**Round 3, No. 64 overall: Jeremy Chinn, S, Southern Illinois** - Chinn was another value selection; arguably our best of the draft. An extremely versatile player, Chinn is projected as a safety who can land solid hits, offers range in coverage and even play a big nickel role. I suspect he’ll spend his rookie year doing a lot of the latter, with Boston and Burris in front of him. But his long term upside with us is undeniable.

**Round 4, No. 113 overall : CB Troy Pride Jr, Notre Dame** - A fast, well sized player, Pride fits the mold of a developmental corner. He’s a good athlete that needs a little help with his instincts and a lot of help with his play physicality. He might work out for us in the long run, but he’ll need some time to develop. 

**Round 5, No. 152 overall: S Kenny Robinson, XFL** - Boy was this an exciting steal. Probably a 2nd or 3rd rounder had he entered the draft a year ago, Robinson was expelled for academic dishonesty and spent last year in the XFL’s St. Louis Battlehawks. He thrived there, immediately starting as one of the best defensive backs in the League. His success against professional talent and his success in college make the ballhawk an extremely intriguing signing. He and Chinn will likely be the future at the position, and in round 5, this was an absolutely outstanding value selection.

**Round 6, No. 184 overall: DL Bravvion Roy, Baylor** - A Matt Rhule guy, Roy had something  of a breakout 2019. While likely little more than run stuffing relief for Brown. He’s strong, but not particularly long or athletic, which will limit his pass rushing upside. But as a late round run blocker, he should be able to contribute for years to come. I like this pick as a supplemental piece, especially as a 6th round selection.

**Round 7, No. 221 overall: CB Stanley Thomas-Oliver III, Florida International** - Here’s a weird one. Thomas-Oliver was a wide receiver at the start of his college career and only moved to corner in 2018. It was a good call and he emerged as a playmaker in 2019 with eight PBUs, two sacks, and interception and two forced fumbles. Despite his limited time as a DB, he clearly has athleticism and instincts, so as a 7th round flier, you can’t complain. Given our lack of depth at CB, I’d be surprised if he *didn’t* make the roster.

Some notable UDFAs include **G Mike Horton out of Auburn**, a two year starter who could push for an early rotational role on a roster this thin and **OT Branden Bowen of Ohio State**, who was excellent last year despite earlier injuries. **LB Chris Orr of Wisconsin** was an awesome blitzing LB in college and offers lots of potential as an up front threat to runners. At WR, the team added **Omar Bayless from Arkansas State**, who surprisingly didn't get drafted. Enormously productive in 2019, there’s little enough in front of him that he could conceivably make the roster. And we added a large number of LBs, at least one of who will probably have a shot at the roster.

#Strengths

**Skill Players** - Samuel and Moore were excellent last year, the latter in particular having a breakout year in spite of a QB who struggled enormously. Rhule’s system offers nothing but upside for Samuel, who has demonstrated a consistent ability to get open and make plays in space when given the ball. Likewise, Ian Thomas has done nothing in his playtime but flash upside, despite having a QB last year who couldn’t get him the ball to save his life. Without Olsen in front of him, I’m expecting a big year. Anderson adds a viable 3rd WR to the mix that’s been sorely lacking. And McCaffery is and remains God. Really, this was a group that performed very well last year, and while I have some doubts about Teddy as a franchise QB, there is no question that represents a massive upgrade over Kyle Allen. I suspect their strong play will continue.

**Pass protection** - Okung, Moton, Paradis and Miller represent a good pass protecting group. Bridgewater should at least be able to stay upright.


#Weaknesses

**Defense** - I’m casting a broad net here, but I feel it’s warranted. Our secondary, pass protection and defensive line are all unproven. There are smatterings of good players there. Short, when healthy, is a stud. Burns was explosive before he got hurt last year. Shaq Thompson is solid and Tre Boston was quite good. Beyond that? Everyone is a question mark. Not like a “these guys have shown upside and downside” question mark. I mean, they’re totally unknown. Either rookies or guys whose performance is so erratic or sparse that it’s impossible to say much. I suspect the theme of the 2020 Carolina Panthers is “growing pains”, and nowhere will that be as true as the defense. We’re leaning heavily on youth and inexperience here, and it’s gonna be rough.

**Interio OL:** While I’m confident in Moton and Okung, the run blocking prowess of the interior scares me. This is not a good group. Dailey played like shit last year and Paradis is clearly not what he used to be. Scoffield and Miller, despite being as uninspiring as it comes, will be the starters almost by default. It’s possible that Little steps up to save us, but I’m not gonna hold my breath. If McCaffery takes a step back this year, the sorry state of the OL will be why.

**Depth:** We are not a deep roster. In addition to the holes listed above, we’re pretty much one injury away from any position but WR being a complete train wreck. We’re a team with clear cut starters, and nothing but murky depths behind them. 

#Projected Lineup/Battles

Rather than creating an exhaustive depth Chart, I’m gonna sketch this out roughly. It’s obvious who our starters are, but the depth beyond them is too wide open to predict at this time.

Starters are bold.

**QB, Teddy Bridgewater,** PJ Walker, Will Grier - Grier showed nothing last year, but his third round status means he probably won’t get cut. I do expect Walker to jump him on the depth chart, but Teddy is the starter.

**RB, Christian McCaffery,** Reggie Banonfanon, Alex Armah, Rodney Smith - CMC is and will remain the center of our offense. Banofanon is the backup, and Arham will be our FB. That much is guaranteed. The rest? I’m making the hot take that Rodney Smith is the 4th man on the roster. He just seems to have more upside than Jordan Scarlett and Mike Davis, though I wouldn’t be surprised if either rounds out the roster instead.

**WR, DJ Moore, Curtis Samuel, Robby Anderson,** Pharoah Cooper, Omar Bayless, Seth Roberts - Matt Rhule loves wideouts, but this is a roster with very little to get excited about outside of the three starters. That’s why I think Bayless makes the team. Roberts is a roster lock, and Cooper can play wideout and serve as a returner.

**TE, Ian Thomas**, Chris Manhertz, Who the fuck even knows who else? - Manhertz is a realy good blocker and Thomas is the clear favorite for the top slot. Everyone else is either an UDFA rookie or an utter no-name. Would not be surprised to see us add talent as teams make roster cuts.

**LT, Russel Okung, RT, Taylor Moton,** Greg Little, Tyler Marz, Mike Horton - The starters are good. The depth is a joke. Marz and Horton make this list simply because everyone else on it is so uninspiring. 

**G, John Miller, Michael Schofield,** Denis Daley, Who the fuck knows who else? - *Y I K E S*

**DL, Brian Burns, Kawaan Short, Derrick Brown,** Efe Obada, Christian Miller, Yetur Gross-Matos, Bravvion Roy, Zach Kerr, Chris Smith, Stephen Weatherly - Those three in bold are starters. The rest I expect to see in a rotation. If you had to pick another starter out here, it’d be Weatherly, I guess, but it’s anyone’s game. There’s a lot of upside here but little proven talent.

**LB, Shaq Thompson, Tahir Whitehead** Who the fuck knows who else? - We took a handful of late round LBs last year who will all vie for spots with UDFA rookies we took this year. None of them are any good, so why waste ink on it? Jermaine Carter has upside I guess, but I suspect that most of us are going to spend this year guzzling bourbon and crying over Luke.

**Safety, Tre Boston, Juston Burris**, Kenny Robinson, Jeremy Chinn - This is such a fascinating group. The two in bold are locked in as starters. The latter two intriguing depth who might make a leap. This unit has tons of upside...

**CB, Eli Apple, Donte Jackson,** Cole Luke, Troy Price, Stanley Thomas Oliver, Corn Elder - ...which is good because this unit is ass. Cole Luke is a ghost and Donte Jackson and Eli Apple stink. Troy Price is a roster lock, though a developmental one. I suspect STO and Elder make the team despite the former being a 7th rounder and the latter being piss, because who the hell else on this roster is gonna stop them? I’m just hoping we can snag someone who’s worth a damn from another team after cuts.


**ST, K Graham Gano, LS JJ Jansen** - That’s right, Sly fanboys. I don’t think he makes the team. Joey Slye has an absolute monster of a leg, but an extremely inconsistent one. Gano frankly isn’t much better, but I think the team goes with the older, more proven talent.

#Schedule

Week 1 - Raiders

Week 2 - @Buccaneers

Week 3 - @Chargers

Week 4 - Cardinals

Week 5 - @ Falcons

Week 6 - Bears

Week 7 - @ Saints

Week 8 - Falcons

Week 9 - @ Chiefs

Week 12 - @ Vikings

Week 13 - Broncos

Week 14 - Packers

Week 15 - @ Redskins

Week 16 - Saints

This is an ugly schedule. Looking over it, I see maybe 4 wins. Upside of 6 if our defense surprises. Nothing as low as 2 wins or as high as 7 would especially surprise me, but I think 4 is where we’re at. The Redskins, Lions and Raiders are all games we can win if we come to play, and I’m sure we’ll fuck over one of our division rivals we have no business beating at some point. This is going to be a rough year, though, and I’ll take anything we get.

#In Conclusion

The Carolina Panthers are a team in transition, and we have enough holes up and down the roster that parts of that transition will not be pretty. Still, we’re not without upside. I love our coaching hires, the offensive skill players are imminently talented, and we have major upside with our youth. The pass rush and safety corps in particular have the potential to surprise. But the interior line and (dear God) secondary are bad enough that this will be one of those years where we cheer for what works and hope for the future.

nfl,70,hvtqnm,11,2020-07-22 07:26:04,7,1,"[OC] Modernizing Defunct NFL franchises: The Munice Flyers In the NFL today you cannot cancel a game just because the opponent isn't good enough. If any game looked like it should have been cancelled because of being too much of a mismatch the one played September 21, 2008 would fit the bill. It was a home game for the New England Patriots. They were unbeaten and had been unbeaten the previous year except for a loss in a Superbowl that came after the craziest fluke play of any Super Bowl. Their visitors went 1-15 the previous year and hadn't won a game yet. Players for New England could have been forgiven for wondering why the game was played.

For anyone wondering the Dolphins had their own plans and unleashed the Wildcat offense. They won the game and the division and the Patriots did not even qualify for the playoffs. 

The Munice Flyers might or might not have had to pull off a similar upset but they never got the chance.

Pandemics aside after most seasons fans can simply look at where their team placed within their division to know who they will be playing next year. Simply put, it wasn't always like that. In the NFL, that is, in the APFL's first season there were 41 games between league members. There were 48 games between an APFL member and non member teams.

Organized by Cooney Checkaye, the Munie Flyers were better know as the Congerville Flyers for most of their existence. Mostly playing as a local athletic club before WWI they had a winning record in 1919 and were invited into league.

Their first game of the season was week two and they were destroyed 45-0 by the Rock Island Independents. George Halas of the Decatur Staleys said (in essence) screw this and cancelled their game against the Flyers. Instead they played the Kewanee Walworth Unions, a fairly decent independent team. It was simply a matter of ticket sales. A game against a good independent team would make for better ticket sales than with a bad league team.  

Munice never really recovered. While they were having difficulty scheduling games the players began signing with other teams. They had a game scheduled against the Dayton Triangles in November but it was rained out. After playing, and losing a couple of pro games in 1921 they left the NFL and folded in 1926

There really wasn't much to go on with Munice. I played with a few ideas and none of them fit. Then, as happens, the idea of white wings on a red helmet came to me. I drew it out and then checked to see if any other team (or business) was using the same idea. Red Wing shoes came the closest.

All I have for a logo is [this](https://i.imgur.com/6HAeSBN.gif) It's generic enough to make me wonder if it's real.

Then they robbed a bunch of teams. After they went 3-13 in 1988 and picked QB Troy Aikman first overall in the NFL draft, they would pick QB Steve Walsh in the supplemental draft, forfeiting their first overall pick in 1990 after an abysmal 1-15 campaign. 

Hindsight wasn’t needed to know that this was a bad decision, people were surprised they took two rookie QBs. However, hindsight amplified the decision to colossally bad when they only won a single game(won by steve walsh btw, Cowboys essentially traded their #1 pick to avoid an 0-16 season). 

We all know what happened next, which made this pick meaningless in the long run as they traded Herschel Walker, a running back, for a king’s ransom of players that would lead to a dynasty of three Super Bowls and inflating Emperor Palpatine’s ego to the max. 

Walsh would be traded in the 1990 season to the Saints for a first, second and third(lol Aints). The Cowboys would package two of those picks to the Patriots and sent back players that made little to no impact in their careers. Those picks would lead to two pro bowlers and one perennial all-pro that would be starters on the Cowboys 3 championship runs in DT Russell Maryland(93 Pro Bowl) and OT Erik Williams(3x First Team all-pro). This trade was definitely instrumental to the ‘Boys success in the following years.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

nfl,0,hv9021,65,2020-07-21 09:09:37,9,1,"Will Patrick Mahomes 10-year $450 million deal with the Chiefs hurt their future SB chances? I remember in the past when talented QB's from some good teams demanded a large fat check for their contracts that ultimately caused their teams to spiral down from being a SB caliber team to being a merely SB caliber team. All of this is due to the QB checks consuming too much cap space that other key players leave.

 I have seen it with Joe Flacco, Russell Wilson, and even to some extent Aaron Rodgers. As soon as Flacco and Wilson got their fat checks, the once SB dominant teams regress back being mediocre ones. Rodgers' fat check a few years ago did hurt the packers for some time but they did bounce back to being good again. 

But for the fat checks for the ravens when they had Flacco and the Seahawks, they never recovered from the large deals and now the Ravens are had done well this past season because they got rid of Flacco (though I think the current QB may demand a fat check already) and the Seahawks rebounced from being a mediocre team to being a good team during the regular season. But Wilson demanded another fat check and now the Seahawks may slither back to mediocracy because of that. When Wilson got his first big check, it took a lot of cap space and then the once dominant Seahawks never came back together until this past season. 

The thing is I wonder if Mahomes' big contract will consume too much cap space for the chiefs. No doubt he is a good player but I worry that as we have seen with Wilson, Flacco, and Rodgers, it will spell doom for their chances to go the Super Bowl.

nfl,149,hv7p7u,68,2020-07-21 07:52:42,7,1,"The All-Time Wasted Team: Offense. A good number of great players never win or even get the chance to play in a Super Bowl, but I wanted to make a list showcasing some of the players that never even got a chance to play in the postseason. This is the offense for the All-Time Wasted Team. This list will include players from all throughout the NFL to have never played in a playoff game. 

QB: Charley Johnson. Johnson was an effective starter in the 60's and 70's with a career record of 59-57-8. The first half of his career was spent with the Cardinals and was actually pretty decent considering the era. He put up a record of 36-28-5 in his 7 seasons in St. Louis, along with close to 20,000 yards and over 100 TDs. Whats amazing was that Johnson had two season in which he won over 9 games and another in which his record was 7-1-1. Alas he never made it to the playoffs with St. Louis and wound up in Houston where he put up an abysmal 3-11 record as a starter for the next two seasons. He then went to Denver where again he put up decent numbers, including two more seasons with winning records, but still no trip to the playoffs. He retired after the 1975 season with one Pro Bowl selection, 170 TDs and 0 trips to the playoffs.

RB: Ollie Matson and Floyd Little. I had no idea about Matson before compiling this team and was honestly surprised that there are two RBs in the HOF with no playoff appearances. But that's the case with these two. Matson was an effective flex back in the 50's and 60's for the Cardinals. To start his career, he made 6 consecutive Pro bowl teams and 5 All pro teams . This included a 1956 season where he had over 1100 scrimmage yards in a 12 game season. In all he averaged 900 scrimmage yards his first 6 seasons with the Cardinals to go along with 40 TDs. The second half of his career he spent as a journeyman backup for the Rams, Lions, and Eagles. He retired with 8400 yards from scrimmage and 63 TDs, but also 66 fumbles. Matson was also on teams that were perennial losers as he was on a team with a winning record only twice.

Floyd Little spent his entire career with the Broncos. He was the first pick of the Broncos to sign with the team and wound up rushing for over 6,000 yards in his 9 seasons with the team. He made 5 Pro bowls to go along with 1 All pro selection. He led the league in rushing yards in 1971 and then rushing TDs in '73. Little pretty much carried the Broncos for his first 5 years in the league as they didn't have a winning record until the 1973 and 1974 seasons, coincidentally, when Charley Johnson was the QB for the Broncos.

Flex: Dickie Post. I thought about going with a Fullback for this slot, but seeing as how the All pro team now has Flex position, I'm going with Post. Post's career was rather short, only 3 seasons as effective starter, but still he was electrifying. In those 3 seasons he made 2 pro bowls, averaged 950 yards from scrimmage, and had 17 total touchdowns. Also, in those three seasons, the Chargers put up a winning record each year, but fell just short of making it the playoffs.

WR: Brandon Marshall and Gary Garrison. Looking at Marshall's career is why I initially was interested in making this list. He's top 20 all time in receiving yards, catches, and receiving touchdowns. He made 6 pro bowls and 1 all pro team. He had a 10 season stretch where he averaged 1175 yards and 8 TDs a season, and did this across 4 different teams, spending multiple seasons with each team, yet didn't play in a single playoff game. The closest he came was two separate 10-6 seasons by the Bears and Jets.

Gary Garrison. Garrison played for mainly the Chargers in the 60's and 70's . His best stretch was from 1968-1972 in which he put up 4,500 yards and 42 Tds and made 4 pro bowls. The closest he came to the playoffs was on those Charger teams of the late 60's with Post. San Diego went 8-5-1, 9-5, and 8-6 in 1966, '67, and '68, but wouldn't make it to the playoffs until 1979.

TE: Randy McMichael. McMichael was a serviceable TE for the Dolphins, Rams, and Chargers in the 2000's. In his first 5 seasons with the Dolphins, he put up 3,000 yards and 18 TDs. He later went to the Rams and put up decent numbers with them before going to the Chargers to finish. His numbers are somewhat pedestrian compared to the Tight Ends of today, but he finished with 4,500 yards and 24 TDs. Whats surprising is that he was on 4 different teams that had winning records, but still never got the chance to go the playoffs.

T: Joe Thomas and Ernie McMillan. Joe Thomas' career is probably the most wasted in the history of the NFL. The man made 10 consecutive Pro bowls and made 6 All pro teams. From 2007 to 2017 he was the best player for the Browns and probably the best Tackle in the league. It's truly a shame that he never had the opportunity to showcase his talents on a bigger stage. Ernie McMillan is another good player who was stuck on the horrendous Cardinals teams of the 60's and 70's. He made 4 Pro bowls and started 173 games for the Cardinals. In 1974 the Cardinals did make the playoffs and McMillan did start 11 games for this teams, but I believe that he got hurt and therefore was not able to play in the playoffs.

G: Doug Van Horn and Lance Smith. Both of these guys were dependable Guards for bad teams. Smith started 129 games for the Cardinals in the 80's and 90's before finishing out his last three years with the Giants. Van Horn was a starter for the Giants of the 70's. From '69 to '79 he started 153 games for the Giants. These guys were both dependable and it makes me wonder if they would have gotten more recognition and accolades if they had been on better teams.

C: Jon Morris. Morris was center for the AFL Patriots of the late 60's and early 70's. He was one of the first stars of the AFL, making 7 consecutive Pro bowls and 1 All pro team. Morris started 123 for the Pats before going to Detroit for his last few years. He was actually on the 10 win team for his rookie season, but missed out on the playoffs due to a 12 win season from the Bills.

K: Rian Lindell. Lindell was a kicker from the 00's who spent the majority of his career with the Bills. From '03 to '12 he was the Bills kicker, making 225 out of 270 FGs with his long being 56 yards in 2009. His best FG% during this time was 92% in 2006 when he his 23/25. Before playing in Buffalo, he spent 3 seasons in Seattle. He also spent his final season in Tampa. For kickers all time with over 300 attempts, his 81.2% completion rate puts him at 17th.  

P: Brian Moorman. Moorman was the Punter at the same time that Lindell was the Bills Kicker. From 2001 to 2011 he was the one punting balls in Buffalo and was actually named to two All pro teams back in 2005 and 2006. 

KR: Eddie Drummond. Drummond was a return specialist for the Lions in the early 00's. In 2004 he was All pro after he returned 2 kicks for Td's. He also had two punt returns for TDs that season, along with one each in '02 and '03. 

PR: J.T. Smith. Smith played for the Cheifs in the early 80's before spending his last few years with the Cardinals. In 1979 and 1980, he ran 4 total punts back for TD. From '79 to '81, he returned close to 150 punts for an average of 11.6 per return. In 1980, he led the league in return yards and return yard average in route being named to the Pro bowl and All pro teams.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

nfl,0,hv2fsm,50,2020-07-21 00:31:59,0,1,"Every NFL Teams MLB Parallel In honor of the MLB season starting I would like to compare every MLB teams parallel in the NFL

AFC South

Jaguars Parallel: Seattle Mariners
The Jaguars and the Mariners are both younger teams in their respective leagues with poor on field performance and 0 championships. 

Titans Parallel: Texas Rangers
Both teams have had some great players but have      failed to reach the promised land by the slimmest of margins, as the Titans were 1 yard away from a Super Bowl and the Rangers were 1 strike away.

Indianapolis Colts Parallel: Los Angeles Angels
Both teams histories are defined by their star players. The Angels have arguably the best player ever in Mike Trout and the Colts has had arguably the best quarterback with Peyton Manning. Both teams have won a modest amount of championships with the Colts winning 2 and the Angels winning 1.

Houston Texans Parallel: Tampa Bay Rays 
Two teams the are the newest in their respective leagues, with the Texans joining the NFL in 2002 and the Rays joining in 1998. Both teams have not had success at all as they have 1 championship appearance between them, the Rays in 2008.

AFC North

Browns Parallel: San Diego Padres
Both teams have struggled mightily in the 21st century with long playoff droughts. The Padres haven’t made the playoffs since 2006 and the Browns since 2002. However they have exciting young players with Baker Mayfield and Nick Chubb on the Browns along with Fernando Tatis Jr. and MacKensie Gore on the Padres to help them reach glory.

Ravens Parallel: Arizona Diamondbacks 
Both teams successful teams were based on defensive rosters. The Ravens has Ray Lewis and Ed Reed while the Diamondbacks had Randy Johnson. Also the Diamondbacks used to wear purple as their main color so the color schemes even match up!

Cincinnati Bengals Parallel: Minnesota Twins
Both of these teams were always fringe playoff teams. They would always miss they playoffs or get knocked out in the first round. They also never have any superstar players besides the occasional Boomer Esiason and Joe Mauer. The only thing separating them is that the Twins have one championship while the Bengals have none.

Pittsburgh Steelers Parallel: Boston Red Sox 
Two of the most decorated and respected teams in their respective leagues. They are always good so they are always hated.

AFC East

New England Patriots: St Louis Cardinals
Two of the greatest, most decorated teams in sports. Both have had generational talents leading the way in Adam Wainwright and Tom Brady, but those guys are retiring soon. However, both teams have heirs to their respective thrones with Jack Flaherty taking over for Wainwright and Cam Newton taking over for Tom Brady.

Buffalo Bills Parallel: Colorado Rockies
Both are smaller market, mediocre teams. Never seem to make the playoffs but are never bad enough to land a top pick. Peak mediocrity.

Miami Dolphins: Detroit Tigers
Both teams have the best player in each sport that never won a championship, Dan Marino and Ty Cobb. Both haven’t really been the same since their glory days and are currently stuck at the cellar of the league.

New York Jets Parallel: New York Mets
My personal favorite comparison. It rhymes, it’s in the same city, and they are both disappointments. They both pulled off some incredible underdog stories with the Mets in 1969 and the Jets in Super Bowl III, but recently have been a stinking pile of meh.

AFC West

Denver Broncos Parallel: Atlanta Braves
They’ve both got a couple championships but always seem to fall short right as glory is in their grasp. The Broncos showed it against the Seahawks in 2013 and the Braves showed it in the 90’s against the Twins and Yankees.

Las Vegas Raiders Parallel: Los Angeles Dodgers
Both are in 20+ year championship droughts and have some of the largest fan bases in the league. Although they have been unsuccessful in recent years, people still hate them.

Los Angeles Chargers: No comparison
If I were comparing them to the NBA teams, I would say the Clippers. However, there is no team like the Chargers or Clippers in the MLB, there is no “little brother team”. Sorry Chargers fans, you have no comparison.

Kansas City Chiefs: Toronto Blue Jays
Medium market teams with decent history’s one or two championships and a bright future. The Chiefs look stacked to win another Super Bowl and the Blue Jays have some amazing young prospects. They sky is the limit for both teams.

NFC South

Atlanta Falcons Parallel: Cleveland Indians 
As a Falcons fan, it hurts to relate your team to one as cursed as the Indians but it’s the truth. They both have mediocre histories and terrible luck. They both blew the biggest leads in the championship and a depressing future. Drinks are at my house Indians fans, we’re going to need them.

Carolina Panthers Parallel: Miami Marlins
Both teams are on the younger side in their respective leagues but have had some modest success. The Marlins have won a World Series and the Panthers have made 2 Super Bowls. Bravo to you!

New Orleans Saints Parallel: Houston Astros
Long, terrible histories with scandals left and right. They both have one tainted championship, with the Saints having Bountygate and the Astros having the sign stealing scandal. These franchises are known to play dirty. 

Tampa Bay Bucs Parallel: Pittsburgh Pirates
These Scallywag teams have rich histories but recently have been as mediocre as you can get. They never seem to get any better than they were and are stuck in the eternal loop and mediocrity.

NFC North

Green Bay Packers Parallel: Oakland Athletics 
The A’s are not as successful as the Packers but these are the Blue Bloods of each league. They both don’t get the same amount of hatred as their rivals the Cowboys or Yankees get but these are two of the most historical teams in sports.

Chicago Bears Parallel: Cincinnati Reds
They both had some of the best teams in each of their respective sports but have been fairly bad since. The glory days are over.

Minnesota Vikings Parallel: Colorado Rockies
They make the occasional World Series or Super Bowl but never seem to be able to win it. They are either outmatches or unlucky. They both have somewhat bright futures so a championship is possible.

Detroit Lions Parallel: Milwaukee Brewers
They are both teams that are stuck in the eternal loop of mediocrity. They haven’t won a championship and they might not ever win a championship.

NFC East

Eagles Parallel: Cubs
They both have obnoxious fan bases with die hard fans and long championship droughts. However they both finally won a championship recently in feel good fashion. Good For You!

New York Giants Parallel: Philadelphia Phillies
Some of the Blue Bloods in very large markets with rich history and passionate fans. They are hated by many as they are able to attract free agents but it works in making them successful.

Washington Redskins Parallel: Baltimore Orioles
These teams had their glory days in the 80s and 90s but have recently been the laughing stock of the league. Both owners are not considered good and it’s possible full rebuild mode happens.

Dallas Cowboys Parallel: New York Yankees
Two of the most hated teams in all of sports. They have obnoxious fans, they win every year, and, of course, they are AMERICA’S TEAM! I need no more explanation.

NFC West

Arizona Cardinals Parallel: Chicago White Sox
Teams that are often forgotten but have been around for a long time. They have had some strange moments, such as the Black Sox Scandal, Michael Jordan, and Disco Demolition Night, but they have a bright future. The White Sox have a exciting young core and the cardinals have Kyler Murray and Deandre Hopkins.

LA Rams Parallel: Washington Nationals 
These teams were the laughingstock of the league, but now since they have relocated, they have been successful. The Rams made the Super Bowl in 2018, and the Nats won the World Series in 2019.

Seattle Seahawks Parallel: Kansas City Royals
Have a modest history but have been successful in recent years. The Seahawks won the Super Bowl in 2013 and the Royals won the World Series in 2015. They have their moment every now and again.

San Francisco 49ers Parallel: San Francisco Giants.
Teams with rich histories that have been very successful as of late. They Giants won the World Series in 2010, 2012, and 2014 while the 49ers made it to the Super Bowl in 2015 and 2019.

Building upon the winning entry of Austrian data scientists Philipp Singer and Dmitry Gordeev in [the 2020 Big Data Bowl](https://operations.nfl.com/updates/the-game/2020-big-data-bowl-results/), the Next Gen Stats Analytics team is introducing a set of metrics that use player-tracking data to delve deeper into the ground game, derived from the newly developed ability to calculate **Expected Rushing Yards**.  


Here is how Gordeev explained it on the [2020 Big Data Bowl discussion board](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/discussion/119400): ""If we focus on the rusher and remove other \[offensive\] team players, it looks like a simple game where one player tries to run away and 11 others try to catch him. We assume that as soon as the rushing play starts, every defender, regardless of the position, will focus on stopping the rusher ASAP, and every defender has a chance to do it. The chances of a defender to tackle the rusher (as well as estimated location of the tackle) depend on their relative location, speed and direction of movements.""  


In a complex environment like football, traditional box-score statistics, like rushing yards and yards per carry, lack the context needed to reliably quantify player and team rushing performance. These stats give you only a partial picture of what happened when a rush was attempted -- the ball was moved a certain number of yards -- without telling you very much about how or why the ball-carrier succeeded or failed.  


Expected Rushing Yards offers a collection of derivative metrics that will enhance our understanding of the running game. What are the chances a rusher gains at least 4 yards on a play? Or 10 yards? Or 20?

Ordinarily, I'd attempt some sort of bottom-tier humor to highlight my suffering of watching this team and then writing about them. Who does that, honestly? But really, given the state of affairs around the country and the world right now, I'll start this piece by reminding you all to be good to each other. Please stay safe through the pandemic and do your best to keep others safe, this isn't something to be trifled with and your actions affect both yourself and everyone around you.

Ahh what the heck, [mfw 2020 edition](https://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/166651/08f.jpg).

With that said (and my bad humor bit out of the way), hello everyone! My name is /u/milkchococurry and welcome once again to the Offseason Review for the Chargers! 2020 was pretty much always going to be a season of change for the Chargers. As SoFi Stadium nears completion, the team [updated its logo](https://twitter.com/Chargers/status/1242541719515574272) and then [got some new threads](https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0422_SPO_LDN-L-CHARGERS-1.jpg). The biggest changes are about to come on the field, as one QB exits and another makes his entrance into Chargers lore as the Bolts look to improve from a disappointing 5-11 season in 2019.

In this review, I'll talk about what has changed for the Chargers so far this offseason and the expectations of the players and team as a whole as the go through training camp and into a potential 2020 season, provided that it happens.

Special thanks:

- /u/PlatypusOfDeath, for setting this series up and doing so much work for it to run as smoothly as possible.

- /u/royziboy, for writing the non-fan review and being swell to talk to that one time.

- To the healthcare workers and first responders who are sacrificing so much for all of us to be safe and healthy during this chaotic and unprecedented time.

- I'd like to thank you all as readers, as there's probably a lot going on in your lives as well and I appreciate that you're reading this mess of words instead of taking care of yourself and the people around you. Wear a mask, you heathens. :P

&#x200B;

Hey Football fans! Have you ever wanted to live the life of a professional football player? Now is your chance. Come create your own football superstar in the International Simulation Football League (ISFL); a simulation football league that uses DDSPF 16 (a football sim engine). 

&#x200B;

In the league, you control only one player. You create your player based on certain archetypes like Speed Rushing Linebacker, Receiving Running Back or Man to Man Corner, and can put points into various attributes to improve your player at creation and over the course of your career. We have a Rookie Mentor Team, a group of people dedicated to helping you create a player and potentially become the next super star of our league!

&#x200B;

After player creation you will work on improving your player and be drafted to a team in our Development League. You will spend a season on this team along with players made by other people learning the ins and outs of the league, and spending time together in the team’s virtual locker room on discord. After one season you will then be drafted by one of our Pro Teams.

&#x200B;

Now you may be asking, how does my player get better? Mainly through activity! You earn points by completing various tasks like a weekly activity check, season and game predictions, and weekly trainings. You will be able to spend your earned points as you want to improve your player, so that one day they'll have the chance to end up in the league's Hall of Fame!

&#x200B;

All the games are streamed live on Youtube using DDSPF 16, so you will get a chance to watch your player. During the season we have games streaming each day, Monday through Friday.

&#x200B;

This league is completely free and run by volunteers! We are a fun community of over 400 users controlling players in the league, which means we have tons of football fans. We have plenty of spots open for rookies!

&#x200B;

We are in the last week of our 23rd season. Wildcard are tomorrow, and Ultimus (the league’s Super Bowl) is Friday. Then the off-season begins with all new players being drafted \[Potentially Thursday August 6th\]. That is two weeks for you to prove to Teams that you deserve being drafted 1st overall. This is a perfect time to join! Come check us out and create your own Hall of Fame player!

| Elandon Roberts | LB | NE |

Byron Jones is the big one here. He will start opposite Xavien Howard and will force teams to throw his way more often, which will lead to more picks. Howard is a ballhawk while Jones is more a lockdown guy. They should make a great duo.

Kyle Van Noy brings a lot of versatility and much needed experience to the defense. He should be a do it all type of guy under Brian Flores and should fill the Kyle Van Noy role that dolphins fans have been talking about since 2019 started. Who better?

Shaq Lawson brings much needed pass rush to Miami. They were downright pathetic in that area last season

Emmanuel Ogbah, see Shaq Lawson.

Jordan Howard, speaking of pathetic, Miami's running attack was beyond that last year. Ryan Fitzpatrick led the team in rushing. Yes, you actually read that correctly. 38 year old bearded non running QB Ryan Fitzpatrick led the dolphins in rushing for 2019. He had a very measly 243 yards. I still smh typing that out. Howard will fix that issue. 

Matt Brieda is the lightning to Howards' thunder. He will take a few to the house from mid field this season.

|---|---|---|
| Reshad Jones | S| FA |
| Taco Charlton | DE | KC |

Reshad Jones was one of my favorite dolphins players of all-time so losing him hurts, but it seems it was just his time to move on. A ring of honor player and maybe the best safety to ever play in a Fins uniform. Hard hitter, makes big plays, lots of pick 6's and game sealing interceptions, great tackler, he will be missed. 
___________________________________________________

**2020 NFL draft selections**

**Round 1, pick 5** - Tua Tagovailoa

Grade - A+

After a year or more of speculation, drooling and hoping for Miami to be in position to grab him, they stayed at number 5, avoided trading up and still got the QB that 99% of Dolphins fans had been praying for. Tua Tagovailoa is a top flight quarterback coming out of college injuries or not. His accuracy and ability to hit receivers in stride in incredible. He doesn't have a huge arm but it's definitely adequate and he maintains that accuracy all over the field. He has touch and great instincts to find the open man. He avoids the sack well, which is something he's gonna have to utilize heavily due to the fact the Dolphins haven't been able to put together a respectable offensive line consistently for the past decade. It's unlikely he'll start right away due to the hip injury he suffered last November and since Ryan Fitzpatrick is in position to maintain his starting role. The covid pandemic did not help him in getting experience, but it did give him more time to rehab. Last I checked Tua had the number 1 and 2 selling jersey in the NFL. To say the least, Dolphins fans are very excited about his arrival. 

**Round 1, pick 18** - Austin Jackson OT USC

Grade - B+

This was a pick that sort of divided the fanbase a little bit. He has high upside but is also so young and raw that a lot of fans were justifiably worried he was a reach and wouldn't live up to being the 18th overall selection. He is very athletic and a very hard worker so that's a good sign for his future. He also gave bone marrow for his sister to save her life and somehow still came back and played college football that same year. Absolutely incredible. Personally just that makes me a huge fan of his, but watching his tape he does have some flaws. He played a bad game going against AJ Epenesa, a fellow first rounder in this year's draft. AJ is a very strong player though and even great players have certain guys that give them trouble. He should man the left tackle spot for at least 3 years. There's a good chance he will see a trial by fire season in 2020. 

**Round 1, pick 30** - Noah Igbinoghene DB Auburn

Grade - A-

This was the first pick that surprised Dolphins fans. Many believe that the Dolphins were targeting a different player at number 26, their original pick, but that player was gone so they traded back. Igbinoghene is an exciting player though. He is figured to man the slot CB position and seems like he has star potential there. It won't hurt having other great CB's like Xavien Howard and Byron Jones to learn from and play next to. He's fast and plays tough. He loves to jam guys and has great play speed to make pass break ups, but he is still pretty raw since he's only been playing defense for a couple years. Should have all the opportunity to snag a ""starter"" spot as the nickle corner. Most think Bobby McCain will stay at safety so he only needs to beat out Nik Needham who was an undrafted rookie last year. Though Needham did show promise so it isn't a cakewalk. 

**Round 2, pick 39** - Robert Hunt OL Louisiana- Lafeyette

Grade - B

Nobody was surprised that the dolphins would draft 2 offensive lineman out of their first four picks, but not many saw that guy being Hunt. He plays aggressively and should be a road grader in the run game, though his pass blocking needs refinement. His strength and playstyle will likely give him a leg up on his competition at either right guard or right tackle since head coach Brian Flores loves toughness on the field. He will be given a shot at beating out Jesse Davis for the right tackle spot but will likely land at right guard since he will probably need time to develop at tackle first. Fellow draftee Soloman Kindley, Danny Isidora and Michael Dieter will be competition for him to start. 

**Round 2, pick 56** - Raekwon Davis DL Alabama

Grade - B-

Davis is strong and plays with a high motor, but lacks great athleticism so his future is a bit murkier than the first 4 players taken by the dolphins. He has versatility and will probably play both tackle and end, allowing for others to move around. 

**Round  3, pick 70** - Brandon Jones S Texas

Grade - C+

Jones is projected to be more of a SS than a FS, which makes sense because Reshad Jones is no longer with the dolphins. Brandon Jones has big shoes to fill there. The athleticism and physicality are there, though the ball skills and coverage ability are not. He's gonna have to be kept clean by the coaching staff and his fellow defensive backs if he's going to be able to play a ton of snaps and succeed. 

**Round 4, pick 111** - Solomon Kindley OG Georgia

Grade - B

Kindley is a destroyer in the run game. He plays to not only win his rep but to shame his opponent. He should be able to find a spot on the line if his pass blocking can even be adequate. Definitely a decent pick at a position of need. 

**Round 5, pick 154** - Jason Strowbridge DL North Carolina

Grade - B-

Another defensive lineman. I see a theme here this offseason.


**Round 5, pick 164** - Curtis Weaver DE Boise St. 

Grade - A

Clearly the defensive line was an issue for the dolphins in 2019. Weaver brings some real potential but lacks explosiveness off the edge. Great pickup in the 5th. 

**Round 6, pick 185** - Blake Ferguson LS (longsnapper) LSU

Grade - D-

I wrote out longsnapper because I'm not sure one has ever been drafted before so maybe some don't know. He will be the only one on the team and has already led to the release of LS Taybor Pepper who was building a gym for his Miami home and posting about it when the news broke. Ouch.

**Round 7, pick 246** - Malcolm Perry RB/WR

Grade - A

Perry is a very elusive player that brings a bit of excitement for being drafted so late. He caused an insane amount of missed tackles in 2019 but against bad competition. Obviously it is yet to be seen if he can keep that up against vastly better competition, either way, getting a player with actual potential this late is a steal.

**Offseason news**

This was a blissfully peaceful offseason for Dolphins fans (2020 BS excluded). There was one minor incident with Xavien Howard that looked like it could end with a four game suspension but it did not. All charges were dropped and NFL didn't see enough to give any punishment. Maybe the biggest story was Saints WR Michael Thomas losing his damn mind when DeVante Parker tweeted out ""A"". It was in response to the question ""Which is tougher? A. Make a catch while guarded by Stephon Gilmore, or B. Break up a pass while guarding Michael Thomas."" It was a far cry from pretty much every offseason Miami has had for nearly twenty years. Pretty much the rest of the story has been Tua, Tua, Tua.

___________________________________________________

**Scheme**

*Offense* - Spread offense

Chan Gailey has typically used the spread offense throughout his career so that's expected to be the case here in Miami. In the spread offense the basic idea is to force the defense to cover a lot of wideouts in order to open up the run game and pass option, or rpo. [Here](https://youtu.be/B3D5MDpiKEY) legendary coach Urban Meyer explains it a million times better than I can, which makes sense since he knows it a million times better.

*Defense*

The defense the dolphins will use is a tricky one. They will likely switch between 3-4 and 4-3 regularly and will use many different formations within each one. OLB's will also get after the QB like a DE, DE's will likely slide inside to the DT position, as well. The idea behind the defense is to always have good matchups on the field and to lockdown the receivers with great man to man coverage, allowing the defensive line to get pressure on the QB. It's quite the opposite of what Miami has done in the past, which was to try and get after the QB ASAP and pray that your DB's didn't allow a quick reception, which they usually did. 

In the past Miami had such great ideas as sending the DE's around the edge quickly but playing off coverage and not trying to take the wideouts off the mark, which almost always just ended up in the QB getting rid of the ball quickly to a wide open receiver running across the middle. Most Dolphins fans found it frustrating to say the least. This new scheme is the opposite of that. They want the DB to knock the wideouts off of his route, while the DE's will play a more contain style and keep the play in front of them rather than running upfield and out of the play. I'm far from an expert on this subject though. Hopefully some of the great Dolphin fans will come on here and clear it up better than I can.

Tough schedule for 2020. Starts tough and ends tough. Not a lot of room for error if they want to remain relevant after the bye week. One good thing is there's 3 west coast teams coming to Miami this year and in the past west coast teams have not played well going east and especially going to Miami. It's gonna be tough to make a playoff push, their best bet is to win at home and try and go 4-2 in the division by splitting the Bills and Pats and trying to sweep the Jets. All four teams in the East are looking like they aren't separated by a lot so it's anyone's guess if New England does indeed slip after losing Brady. I'll believe that when I see it. 

Big shoutout to guys like Kyle Crabbs and Travis Wingfield for helping teach me a lot of this stuff, I leaned heavily on Crabbs' scouting profiles for the draft section, and Wingfield taught me quite a bit about formations. Hopefully I'm not making his teaching look bad 😂. Another shoutout to all the Dolphins fans in Miami dealing with a big covid breakout in Florida.

nfl,8,huhohj,37,2020-07-20 02:26:02,2,1,"Three Possible Overtime Rule Changes Worth Considering I've been visiting this sub for close to a decade, and I don't think I've seen any rule complained about as much as the NFL's overtime format.  I've seen a lot of bad and questionable suggestions to fix it, but I've also seen a few that I feel would be an improvement.  I at least think they deserve more discussion. 

First the most brought up:

\*\*College OT rules\*\*  

Pro: both offenses touch the ball

Con: Statistically gives an even bigger advantage to winner of coin toss, as they know whether to go for it on fourth and whether or not to go for two

&#x200B;

\*\*Current NFL Rules (sudden death), but receiving team can't win on first possession, even with a TD\*\*

Pros and cons are pretty much the same as college, but with an even bigger advantage given to the winner of the coin toss, who under these conditions would elect to kick off.

&#x200B;

\*\*Full OT period played out. No sudden death\*\*

Pro: no first possession walk-off touchdowns.

Cons: Player's Association would most likely be against it for potential for long games.  Also, still a slight advantage for receiving team.

&#x200B;

\*Now suggestions that, while maybe not perfect, seem like an improvement to current rules\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Current rules, but receiving team has to get 8 on first drive to win\*\*

Obviously the big con to this is that the opposing offense could still wind up never touching the ball, but at least with this rule, that would only happen if their defense gives up a touchdown AND a two-point conversion.  The kicking team could still win with a field goal. With these rules, I don't think receiving in OT would be such a no-brainer.

&#x200B;

\*\*College Rules, but eliminate two-point conversions and PATs.\*\*

If everyone is going for it on 4th and going for two, it eliminates the advantage of going second.  Conversely, you could make it a rule that teams have to kick on fourth and take the PAT, though I'm not sure what would happen in the case of the latter with a muffed snap.

\*\*Eliminate kickoff and bid for starting field position, with sudden death\*\*

Probably the most different out of all the suggestions I've seen, but basically, say Pats are playing Saints.  Belichick says, ""We'll take it on the 17"" Payton, ""We'll take it on the 16"" Belichick,  ""15"" Payton, ""14"", Belichick, ""Take it"" 

So the Saints would start on their own 14, and it's back to old sudden death rules. It's possible the kicking team's offense never sees the field, but at least that was by choice.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I did this pretty quickly so if any of these are wrong feel free to correct it!

Please note that this is purely based on win count between two seasons and not win percentage. This was the easiest way to tally up the numbers and I understand that some of this info may be inaccurate due to some seasons being shorter than others. For instance, I put the Redskins' greatest turnaround to be from going 8-1 in 1982 to 14-2 in 1983 as well as Seahawks being 4-5 in 1982 and 9-7 in 1983 just because of win count. But of course there was a strike-shortened season in 1982 and it's weird to consider the Redskins going from winning the SB to losing the SB as being a great turnaround. And some of these came from seasons with one or more ties, but again for the sake easiness and time, I only looked at the wins.

Plenty of solid offensive weapons, and a few studs on defense. Both teams coming off a bad record with an unproven coach.

nfl,0,htwb40,55,2020-07-19 00:55:32,0,1,"The teams that stand to lose the most by not playing a season are: Chiefs, 49ers, Bucs, Saints and Titans There are many teams that could take a step forward next year, but none have as much to lose as the 5 teams I’ve mentioned.

You could make an argument for the Ravens, but now that teams have tape on their offense, I don’t see how they won’t be slowed down next year, especially considering how they were rendered almost useless by the combination of the rushing attack and run D of the Titans in the divisional round of the playoffs.

You could also say that the Steelers might lose out on a playoff spot, but outside of getting Big Ben back, I don’t see how they will improve as a team next year. Even with Ben, they would have been a wild card team at best, and I don’t see how they can position themselves as an elite AFC team. 

The Chiefs are the obvious choice because they’re bringing back almost their whole roster and coaching staff, and the 49ers have the same argument.

The Bucs gave Brady and Gronk and Arians obviously. The Saints are returning a large portion of their roster as well, and this is their last year in the current window for a championship.

Lastly, the Titans are bringing back a top-5 QB (in 2019) as well as the league leader in rushing (while only playing 15 games). They also have a budding superstar in AJ Brown, and are bringing back 10/11 starters on offense. The defense is the question mark here, but if they are able to sign Clowney as many are speculating, their defense would go from good to upper echelon, putting them in competition for the bye week.

I constantly see people asking about how to watch the NFL. I figured it would be nice if I had a little guide since some may find the info useful. I personally prefer to keep things legal. If you are comfortable streaming games illegally, more power to you. This is a guide to watching games live legally, which means it won't be for free.

**Three Types of NFL Games**

*Local Broadcast* - These are games played on Sundays at 1PM EST or 4PM EST that are *in your market*. These games are always on one of two broadcast stations, CBS or FOX.

*Out Of Market Broadcast* - These are games played on Sundays at 1PM EST or 4PM EST that are *out of your market*. These games are always on one of two broadcast stations, CBS or FOX.

*National Games* - There are at least three national games per week, SNF on NBC (Broadcast), TNF on NFL Network (Cable) or FOX (Broadcast) or Amazon Prime (Streaming), and MNF on ESPN (Cable)

2020 features no London games, although those are normally broadcast on NFL Network. But it's not a worry this year.

**How To Watch Football**

*Cable* - Let's start here because this is what most people either have or at least grew up with. Assuming you are at a tier with NFL Network, a 'standard' cable package will get you CBS (Broadcast), NBC (Broadcast), FOX (Broadcast), ESPN (Cable), and NFL Network (Cable). That gets you every local market broadcast game plus SNF, TNF, and MNF. Of course, the average monthly cable bill is over $200 (and you get like...other stations and stuff for non-football watching).

*Antenna* - Digital antennas are a one-time purchase. They cost anywhere from $20-$50 depending on what you want/need. They allow you to get all of the broadcast stations (assuming your house/apartment is able to pick up the signals) for no monthly cost. So with this, you'll be able to get every local broadcast Sunday game, TNF, and SNF. You miss out on MNF with just the antenna but again, no extra monthly cost in there.

*Sunday Ticket* - Sunday Ticket is a service the NFL provides that is intended for those with Direct TV satellite service. There are also some other criteria that would make you eligible for Sunday Ticket without the Direct TV service (living somewhere that is not eligible for Direct TV, being in college, certain metropolitan cities, etc). Sunday Ticket gets you OUT OF MARKET Sunday games. It's important to note that Sunday Ticket EXCLUDES (blacks out) local broadcast games. It also doesn't show TNF, SNF, or MNF games. 

The price of Sunday Ticket ranges considerably depending on your situation. The cheapest option I see for an NFL Sunday Ticket package WITH DIRECT TV seems to be $80/month for the first year and $85/month for the second year. Obviously you get other stations along with that. If you are able to get Sunday Ticket Streaming without Direct TV, I believe the cost is $400 for the season. It's worth noting that if you are a college student or ya know...know someone who is...the student price for Sunday Ticket is $100 for the season.

**Other Options**

*Youtube TV* - $65/month. Gets you the local broadcast games, TNF, SNF, and MNF. Good option if you are a fan of multiple local sports teams as Youtube is one of the few streaming services that gets local cable sports stations (Regional Sports Networks aka RSN's) that show your local MLB/NBA/NHL games (Caveat that they have dropped some cities RSN's so you need to check [here](https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/)). Also worth noting that it DOES NOT have NFL Network, which I don't believe precludes you from watching any games this year as TNF is simulcast on FOX in 2020 and there are no London games. In a ""normal"" year, London games are usually not shown on a broadcast station.

*FUBOTV* - $55/month. Another good option on paper although I can't speak to the reliability/quality of the service. They are adding ESPN/ABC this year so that would cover MNF. FUBO has the local NBC Sports stations but DOES NOT have the local FOX Sports stations. So depending on whether you care about MLB/NBA/NHL and whether those teams are housed at NBC Sports or FOX, it might determine your willingness to buy in. I also am reading that live sports are streamed at only 720p but again, I can't comment directly on that!

*HULU Plus Live* - $55/month - Similar to FUBO or Youtube TV. [Check local RSN's here](https://thestreamable.com/news/what-regional-sports-networks-rsns-are-available-on-hulu-heres-the-full-list-fox-sports-nbc-sports). Depending on your location, this is a good option. Has ESPN but doesn't have NFLN. Has all the local broadcast stations. I am reading they are upgrading to 1080p for ""certain channels and devices"" so I'm not sure exactly what that would mean for football.

*Sling (Orange)* - $30/month - Just putting it here for completion-sake...it just gets you ESPN for the MNF game. It doesn't have the local broadcast games or NFL Network. But it does have a decent set of cable stations (and TNT, which can be a little tricky to get legally if you're into basketball). So doing the antenna plus Sling for $30 a month is a reasonable way to go for a casual NFL/NBA fan.

*ESPN/Disney+/HULU* - $13/month. Gets you the MNF game plus Frozen 2....for the uhhh...kids to watch repeatedly. Yeah, the kids. That's it.

*Philo* - $20/Month. Gets you no football. I don't know why I put it here.

**Summary**

Personally, I am able to get Sunday Ticket without DirectTV and I have an antenna. I am able to watch every locally broadcast game, both in market and out of market. I think if I didn't have that, I might give FUBO a whirl since it has my RSN's. I probably missed some options as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

# 2019 Summary

Division: NFC East (4-12, 3rd)

Before I start I just want to warn everyone that I'm generally incredibly long-winded. So: if you don't want to read all of my commentary and just want the tl;dr version, I will put that in a comment and link that comment [<<<HERE>>>](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/htfwcm/offseason_review_new_york_giants_edition/fygh7sh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) The tl;dr version will mostly just be a few tables of main coaching changes, free agency, draft, predicted record, without any of my notes. Now that that's done:

Ups:

* Daniel Jones flashed the ability to be a legit player for the Giants, starting with his first start, a wild one in TB where he led a game-winning drive.
* Darius Slayton surprised as a good WR after being selected in the 5th round.
* Ryan Connelly played well out of the gate as a 5th round rookie LB.
* Dalvin Tomlinson had a more productive year as a pass rusher

Downs:

* Injuries were a significant problem; Saquon Barkley, Sterling Shepard, Evan Engram, Jabrill Peppers, and Daniel Jones all missed games with injuries.
* Very few of the young players the Giants added to the roster under Dave Gettleman took steps forward; Jones and Dexter Lawrence were good, but DeAndre Baker, Will Hernandez, BJ Hill, Lorenzo Carter, and Oshane Ximines, the rest of the Giants top 100 picks under Gettleman (besides Barkley who we know is good), all struggled at times or had their roles reduced at times.
* Many veterans the Giants would need to rely on struggled; Nate Solder, Janoris Jenkins, Alec Ogletree for example.
* The Giants only won 4 games all year, being among the worst teams in the league, and in many of their games, were down by 10+ points at some point in the first half.

So it came as no surprise when HC Pat Shurmur was fired after this up and (mostly) down season. However, in a move that surprised many (myself included) GM Dave Gettleman was retained.

MASSIVE turnover here, with just 2 main coaches retaining their positions: WR Coach Tyke Tolbert and STC Thomas McGaughey.

**HC Joe Judge Grade: A-**

>When Judge was first hired, I will not lie, I was not really happy. Personally, I was a big Matt Rhule proponent; I love his resume, going to two different low quality colleges and flipping their programs around in a very short time.  
>  
>But the more I see of Joe Judge, the more comfortable I am with the hire. Not ecstatic, not expectant of him to be great, but comfortable. He's the kind of coach I thought this team needed.  
>  
>It turns out, the Giants had done their homework on Joe Judge. Judge had been with Bill Belichick and the Patriots since 2012, he had been their STC since 2015. Before that he had worked for Nick Saban at Alabama. The Giants polled both of those legendary coaches for their takes on Joe Judge, and it seemed that both really raved about Judge.  
>  
>On top of that, John Mara claimed Judge's interview was one of the most impressive he's ever been a part of. He really sold ownership on his plan for the future of the team.  
>  
>His arrival signals a bit of a shift in what ownership wants in its HC. The last two times, with Ben McAdoo and Pat Shurmur, it seemed that the Giants tried to go with the trend of finding hot offensive minds to design and build an offense that would carry the team to wins. But with Judge, they are bringing in someone who is going to try to oversee the whole operation, instead of hone in very closely on one element and leave the rest alone. Specific gameplans will be delegated, while he ensures that the team is working as a single cohesive unit instead of multiple disjointed ones.  
>  
>Judge's background is in special teams, but he'll have a say in the offense and defense. He'll have a huge say in roster building and construction, because as a special teams coach he had to evaluate players on both sides of the ball already.  
>  
>The challenge here for Judge is that he's never been a HC before at any level. So he's mostly going off of his own intuitions and what he learned from coaching with Nick Saban and Bill Belichick (the latter of whom apparently had consistent and lengthy conversations with Judge about being a HC). Plus he will have to rely somewhat heavily on his assistant coaches to help put together a strong offense and strong defense, since that's somewhat outside of his repertoire.  
>  
>It's hard to really grade a HC hire before they actually do anything, but I'm happy with what Joe Judge seems to be bringing to the table.

**OC Jason Garrett Grade: B**

>I think I like the Jason Garrett hire, but it doesn't come without faults. First of all, there's the obvious: Hiring coaches that were thrown away from other orgs, especially rival orgs, is usually a tough sell. And since Garrett's offense hasn't run incredibly well the last couple of years (and it seemed the Cowboys offense performed better when Kellen Moore had more say in recent years), that's a bit concerning.  
>  
>The next thing is a long term thing; if he's good, how long is it before he gets another bite at the HC apple? And if he's not good, how long would he last? It doesn't seem like the type of hire that is made to last, but that we will have to see. Maybe his tenure in Dallas turns everyone off enough to not hire him, who knows?  
>  
>I think I trust Garrett a lot schematically in the run game, where his teams in Dallas have been extremely multiple. They shifted between man/gap/power/inside zone/outside zone schemes year to year, or even play to play pretty consistently. Garrett has almost always had a stellar runningback in recent years, with Demarco Murray and now Zeke, and has been able to shift his scheme without a problem. The main concern about this is that the Giants OL has been a weakness, compared to the Cowboys' which was undoubtedly a strength.  
>  
>The biggest concern to me as far as his success with the team goes is how his scheme will mesh with Daniel Jones. Jones is really the key to a lot of the Giants success for the next decade; he'll get a good long look as the future of the franchise, and it's important that he's set up for success.  
>  
>Jones flashed on his rookie film, but there's places he still needs to improve. The first thing everyone will say is ball security, not fumbling in the pocket, but it's deeper than that; in my opinion he really struggled to find comfort in his progressions. Quick throws or first reads were routine for him, but when he had to move off and find the window for his next read, often times he seemed quite uncomfortable. His footwork would accelerate, he'd start pumping and patting the football, and often times he'd be late. This was a significant portion of his propensity for fumbles, along with a weak OL. His deep ball placement needed improvement as well.  
>  
>Garrett's offense is going to really challenge him to improve there; Garrett will implement more vertical concepts into the offense, he wants to be aggressive and be able to push the ball downfield with the first read, and then have the QB move on if it's not there. That's going to challenge Jones to improve on those things.  
>  
>And if Jones is able to meet the challenge (which I hope he can), then this will be great for him. But those things will also exacerbate his weaknesses; if he gets off to a slow start, **IT'S OKAY.** But that's why I am pumping the brakes on Jason Garrett a bit.

**DC Patrick Graham Grade: C+**

>Graham doesn't really have an impressive resume, with last year being his first year as a full-fledged Defensive Coordinator. Miami's roster was very weak, so it's no surprise the defense put up poor results.  
>  
>The main thing that makes me uninspired with this hire is...it doesn't make sense to me why the Dolphins just...let him go. The Giants requested permission to interview him for a completely lateral move (he did gain an ""Assistant HC"" title with the Giants, but that's not considered a promotion) and the Dolphins just said ""see ya"". It doesn't make sense to me.  
>  
>The good thing about Graham is that he really embodies the ""multiple"" defense philosophy. He worked with a ton of spare parts in Miami, but they still ran a lot of different schemes, depending on the opponent. If he can bring that philosophy to the Giants, that will be exciting, after watching a very vanilla defense for a long time now. If he can find creative ways to use the players on this roster, and specifically produce a pass rush from a weak pass rusher group, then this will be a success.  
>  
>And I can't blame him if the defense isn't good; there's a lot of missing pieces with this defense still. I'm not saying he'll be a failure, but there's not a lot of reason on the board so far to be particularly excited.

**STC Thomas McGaughey Grade: A+**

>It's not often you see someone get excited for a STC hire, but McGaughey was one of two assistants retained from Pat Shurmur's staff, and it's well deserved.  
>  
>McGaughey's arrival in 2018 really helped flip the Giants' special teams identity. While still generally a weaker returning team, kick coverage especially has been incredible. Players rave about his simple yet effective scheme, how it encourages them to play fast and loose, and we've seen it really pay off, with a few players like Michael Thomas, Cody Core, and Antonio Hamilton earning basically their whole paycheck on special teams.  
>  
>McGaughey and Judge will be a fun combination since they're both high quality special teams coordinators, and frankly with how people talk about McGaughey, I wouldn't be surprised to see him get some HC interviews in the next few years.

**Best of the Rest Grade: A**

>I'm really a big big fan of almost all of the other hires Judge made. I was very concerned at first that it would just be filled with Alabama/NE assistants, and there are some of those, but Judge really made this staff his own and brought in some very talented people.  
>  
>**QB Coach Jerry Schuplinski** has received rave reviews from guys like Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett for the way that he communicates concepts and can really be an asset especially for young QBs.  
>  
>**RB Coach Burton Burns** was loved at Alabama and former Alabama RBs like Mark Ingram came out to say how much they loved him.  
>  
>**WR Coach Tyke Tolbert** has been quite good for the Giants, including playing a pivotal role in the great rookie year that Darius Slayton had in 2019.  
>  
>Possibly the acquisition most Giants fans are most excited for is **OL Coach Marc Colombo**; Colombo played for Jason Garrett and then went up through the ranks to become the Cowboys' OL coach for the last couple of years. Now, the Cowboys OL was full of talent to begin with, but Colombo hopefully can help improve the Giants OL and get players like Will Hernandez to really come into their own.  
>  
>The last hire I want to highlight is **DB Coach Jerome Henderson.** Henderson is another player-turned-coach who has been coaching DBs for 15ish years in the NFL, most recently being Atlanta's passing game coordinator. Henderson doesn't have the most incredible track record of developing corners the way someone like Josh Boyer does, but he's experienced. This hire isn't one of my favorites, but it's an important one, since the Giants CB room is still incredibly young.

The Giants barely lost any players of real note this offseason; that's kind of what happens when your team is really bad and in year 2 or 3 of a rebuild.

Overall Grade: **A**

>Overall I give the Giants an A for all the players that walked, because none of them were important to keep.  
>  
>I love Eli as much as anyone, but it was time, and I'm glad he retired a Giant instead of trying to milk another year out of his career elsewhere. Same with Zak DeOssie.  
>  
>The Alec Ogletree experiment was not a success, being a pretty weak LB that was paid far too much for the quality of his play. I won't bash the acquisition because the picks and money didn't mean that much in the end, but he didn't live up to it.  
>  
>Mike Remmers and Antoine Bethea were more or less veteran stopgaps to fill spots on the roster that just couldn't be solved that quickly, and both did fine at that, but were no longer really needed.  
>  
>Janoris Jenkins was released mid-season after a Twitter beef with a fan, but he was going to be released this summer anyways in all likelihood, anyways.  
>  
>Jon Halapio is currently not signed by the Giants, but they are closely monitoring his recovery from a late season Achilles injury. Halapio was the week 1 starter at center both of the last two seasons, and was middling. There's no real reason I feel he needs to be signed, but the center position will be pretty much completely up in the air this summer. The Giants very well may bring him back if they can verify his health.  
>  
>Markus Golden was signed last year as a one year stopgap and performed solidly. He led the team in sacks, was generally steady, but didn't prove a game-changing effect for a terrible pass rush. The Giants were perfectly comfortable letting him walk, and he remains unsigned, because the EDGE market didn't materialize the way people thought; with Clowney and Everson Griffen still unsigned, and Golden not receiving the offers he thought he would, the Giants placed a UFA tender on Golden; that means that if he remains unsigned on the first day of training camp, then his negotiation rights revert to the Giants. This means that if Golden doesn't sign somewhere by then, then the only team he can play for is the Giants, and the Giants have a minimum offer of his 2019 contract with a 10% salary bump; this means that if Golden does come back to the Giants then, he will sign for 1 year, \~$5.1m (a $4.1m salary plus $1m in LTBE bonuses).

>It would not hurt my feelings if none of the above players returned, so I think the Giants did a fine job here.

* **Leonard Williams Grade: B-**

>The thing with Williams is that the Giants almost had no choice but to tag him. You can't trade for a player when you're like 2-6 and firmly out of the playoff hunt and then let them walk after the season, it just makes you look doubly stupid. So they kind of have to retain him, which is also probably not a great move.  
>  
>I actually like Williams as a player. I think the raw trade value for Williams was pretty fair. It's the context that doesn't make sense; the Giants could have used their 3rd round pick (though not on a player of Williams' caliber, I truly believe) on a player with less financial impact that maybe could grow into something. And the Giants IDL was generally perceived as a strength; Dalvin Tomlinson is a very good nose tackle, Dexter Lawrence had a really promising rookie year, and while I'm not the biggest BJ Hill fan, for a 3rd IDL in a rotation, he really wasn't a problem.  
>  
>On top of that, Williams had this incredible reputation of just being ""one step late"" on sacks. In his time with the Giants, that didn't change. I'd argue though it's not really his fault as much as it was the fault of the inadequate edge pass rush; if the Giants had been able to rush the passer from the edge, force QBs to step up at all, then I think you'd see Williams on the scoresheet more often, and I think that applies to his time with the Jets as well, who haven't had a good edge pass rusher in I don't know how long.  
>  
>Williams is a good player but it's not clear he's worth the amount of investment the Giants have put into him; this is a really risky move that I don't necessarily see the great upside to.

* **James Bradberry Grade: A-**

>I like James Bradberry, and I think the cost is pretty much going rate. I'm very happy with the term especially, because it frees up the Giants to be more flexible earlier in the contract; if things don't work out, the Giants can release Bradberry after just 2 years with very minimal cap penalties. Compare this to a contract like the one [Byron Jones](https://overthecap.com/player/byron-jones/3875/) signed, and it will take until year 4 to cut Jones without feeling a very significant cap penalty.  
>  
>I think this was a pretty necessary signing, as Janoris Jenkins' release left the Giants pretty barren at the CB position; 2019 1st round pick DeAndre Baker struggled mightily this year, especially early in the season. Supplemental draft choice Sam Beal wasn't healthy until midseason and didn't perform incredibly. And the rest of the CB room was made up almost entirely of late draft choices or UDFAs. So a stable, solid veteran CB was definitely in the cards.  
>  
>There's two things I don't like about the pickup, and both are very minor:

1. How good is James Bradberry really? I'm not convinced he's a true CB1, but he's probably a very good CB2 at least.
2. The Giants originally had proposed a contract that had a much lower signing bonus (if it had one at all), that would have made it possible to cut Bradberry after just one year if necessary. This is incredibly minor because honestly, I doubt that he'd need to be cut after just 1 year.

* **Blake Martinez Grade: B**

>The Giants doled out another 3 year contract, this time worth $30.75m to Blake Martinez.  
>  
>DC Patrick Graham worked with Martinez in Green Bay at one point and probably played a big role in bringing Martinez here.  
>  
>Martinez is more of a box LB, he doesn't bring a lot to the table in coverage, which is where the Giants really really need help. He racked up tackles at an incredible rate in 2019, but he was mostly a ""cleanup"" guy, not really creating a lot of opportunities for himself.  
>  
>I personally worry this will be Alec Ogletree 2.0: another investment by the Giants into a bigger name at LB who just won't live up to the expectations they put on him. He'll almost unquestionably where the signal-caller's green dot on his helmet, but his level of play matching his contract is the biggest question mark for me.

* **Kyler Fackrell Grade: B-**

>This is another super low risk signing, similar to how Markus Golden was signed prior to the 2019 season. It's a short deal for a player who had a career year working with Graham before.  
>  
>It became clear early on in FA that Markus Golden wasn't coming back for what the Giants were offering, and they knew that all of the good free agents would be tagged, with the exception of Clowney, who was reportedly asking too much for the Giants to give, so the Giants targeted Fackrell. He was pushed down the depth chart by the addition of the Smiths in GB, and the Giants are hoping that adding him to Lorenzo Carter and Oshane Ximines, along with a better defensive scheme, will help put together a somewhat competent edge pass rush.  
>  
>Fackrell just isn't an incredibly impressive player; I'm not unhappy with him being signed, but it just doesn't move the needle.

* **Other Moves**

>Levine Toilolo is a blocking specialist TE, something the Giants will need for Garrett's scheme. They paid him a lot but having Toilolo gives the Giants a steady/stable option in case Engram can't stay healthy and/or Smith has a sophomore slump.  
>  
>Cameron Fleming is a solid swing tackle who is familiar with Judge and Garrett/Colombo. He'll be a really useful player to step in and play in case of injury, as well as help the young OL the Giants have brought in adapt and develop to the new system.  
>  
>David Mayo is a depth LB/STer at best, really. He was forced into a bigger role due to injuries and was serviceable against the run and a huge liability against the pass. This deal is just a last resort plan.  
>  
>The Giants added two backup QB options; Colt McCoy and Cooper Rush. McCoy as a veteran present to fill the void left by Eli as best he can and help Jones prepare and improve as a professional. Rush serves as a (hopefully) high upside backup who knows Garrett's offense. I wouldn't be surprised to see both carried on a 53 man roster.  
>  
>The Giants also added Casey Kreiter, a former Pro Bowl LS, to at least compete for the job vacated by Zak DeOssie.  
>  
>Lastly, the Giants' focus on ST continued this offseason, replacing Michael Thomas with Nate Ebner from the Patriots and re-signing Cody Core, who was a standout STer for the Giants last year.

# Projected 53 Man Roster

Starters are **BOLD**

QB (3): **Daniel Jones**, Colt McCoy, Cooper Rush

RB (3): **Saquon Barkley**, Dion Lewis, Wayne Gallman

FB (1): Eli Penny

WR (5): **Sterling Shepard, Golden Tate, Darius Slayton**, Corey Coleman, ???

TE (3): **Evan Engram**, Levine Toilolo, Kaden Smith

OL (9): **Nate Solder, Andrew Thomas**, Matt Peart, Cam Fleming, **Will Hernandez, Jon Halapio/Spencer Pulley, Kevin Zeitler**, Shane Lemieux, Nick Gates

DL (6): **Leonard Williams, Dexter Lawrence, Dalvin Tomlinson**, BJ Hill, RJ McIntosh, Austin Johnson

EDGE (4): **Markus Golden, Kyler Fackrell**, Oshane Ximines, Lorenzo Carter

LB (5): **Blake Martinez, Ryan Connelly**, David Mayo, TJ Brunson, Cam Brown

CB (5): **DeAndre Baker**, **James Bradberry**, **Darnay Holmes**, Sam Beal, Corey Ballantine, ???

S (2): **Jabrill Peppers, Xavier McKinney**

DB (2): Julian Love, ???

K (1): Aldrick Rosas/???

P (1): Riley Dixon

LS (1): Casey Kreiter

ST (2): Cody Core, Nate Ebner

**NOTES:**

1. This is assuming DeAndre Baker is good to go and the armed robbery stuff is made up. Frankly at this point I have no clue what will happen; if he's out, then Sam Beal will slide into his spot most likely.
2. ??? means it's basically wide open. For WRs, there's about a 5 way battle between: Austin Mack, Binjimen Victor, Derrick Dillon, David Sills, and Da'Mari Scott. For the extra DB slot, it's between Grant Haley, Montre Hartage, Chris Williamson, Sean Chandler, Rashaan Gaulden, and Dravon Askew-Henry. It's also possible that Beal or Ballantine loses their spot depending on performance.
3. Core is a WR and Ebner is a S, but they're really on this roster for their special teams ability; that's why I listed them separately.
4. Halapio/Pulley are listed that way because I expect only one of them to make the roster; Halapio is currently a free agent while rehabbing from an Achilles injury. If he can prove he's healthy, then I think the Giants will bring him back, and he'll be the starting C week 1 (the Giants have answered every question about their starting C position with him included).
5. Some roster sleepers: Javon Leake (RB), Garrett Dickerson (TE), Carter Coughlin, Oluwole Betiku (EDGE), Tae Crowder, Josaiah Tauaefa (LB)
6. Key future needs: We left with a lot of the same needs we came in with: C, EDGE, WR, possibly LB/TE (depending on Ryan Connelly and Evan Engram/Kaden Smith)
7. Aldrick Rosas was arrested for a hit-and-run, it looks really really bad and he was charged this week, but also as of writing this, the Giants haven't released him, the NFL hasn't suspended him or anything, and the Giants don't have another placekicker on the roster, so we're just going to leave him there, there's no one else to project.

# What to Expect in 2020

**QB:**

>Daniel Jones had a pretty strong rookie year, all things considered. A lot of inconsistency, but he definitely showed that he has the potential to be a franchise QB. The goal is for him to grow and develop this year into that type of player. Limit his turnovers, help the offense run more quickly and smoother, improve on his field vision and progressions, and that'll be a great start. I wouldn't expect him to be an absolutely top tier elite QB like Mahomes/Jackson, or be up there with the old heads like Rodgers and Brees, but hopefully he will be comfortably in the top half of the league's QBs this year with more room to build on.  
>  
>Colt McCoy and Cooper Rush serve as backups that are mostly there to help Jones and his transition from Shurmur's offense to Garrett's.

**RB:**

>Nothing has really changed for the Giants in the RB room; it's still Saquon Barkley's world and we're just living in it. I was kind of wrong last year, I said Saquon would cement himself as a top 3 RB in the league; really weak run blocking and a high ankle sprain really derailed that, but this year is a big bounceback year for him. The hope is that a new scheme, new OL coach, and the addition of Andrew Thomas will really help open holes for Saquon and get him into space, where he works his magic. He will get a lot of touches, especially in the ground game.  
>  
>The Giants brought in Dion Lewis in free agency as well, he'll probably be the relief back. He never really worked out in Tennessee; for the Giants, he'll likely come in mostly on passing downs to spell Barkley, especially on plays where the back is expected to pass protect, a rare weak element of Barkley's game. Past those two, it pretty much is wide open, and the winner of the spot will be whoever contributes most on special teams; Javon Leake has a shot as a kick returner, for example.

**Pass Catchers:**

>Evan Engram is coming off of yet another injury, which is quickly becoming a significant concern; entering the 4th year of his rookie contract, the Giants chose to pick up his 5th year option. Staying healthy for a full 16 games is imperative for him if he wants to stick with the team. There were reports of him possibly being traded, but the Giants know his value pretty much will never be lower and decided to take the gamble. Backing him up you have Levine Toilolo, a blocking specialist acquired in free agency, and Kaden Smith, a waiver-wire pickup from the San Francisco 49ers who showed some promise and upside after Engram was injured.  
>  
>At WR, I first have to admit, Golden Tate was good for the Giants last year. My concerns from when he was signed still stand, and we're not sure when that contract will start to bit the Giants, but in 2019, he was good, after serving a 4 game PED suspension. I wouldn't expect him to be more productive than he was in 2019, however, partly due to aging, partly due to scheme, and partly due to other players emerging/getting healthy.  
>  
>Sterling Shepard was once again a solid, steady player, but struggled to stay on the field, suffering multiple concussions. There is concern amongst Giants fans that one more concussion may end his career, continuing the scary trend of injuries more or less ending the careers of successful Giants WRs; Plaxico Burress, Hakeem Nicks, Victor Cruz, OBJ (I think the ankle injury that cost him the 2017 season was the start of the problems), and now maybe Sterling Shepard. My hope is that he'll stay healthy this year and be a productive WR2.  
>  
>The real key to this group in 2020 is Darius Slayton. The Giants' 5th round draft choice in 2019 had a stellar rookie year, especially for a player of his draft slot. If there's two things the Giants have scouted well in recent, it's DL and WRs. Slayton's production was heavily bolstered by strong TD production, but he added something the offense was severely lacking; a real deep threat option. Hopefully Jason Garrett's system will help unlock more of his potential. He needs to have steadier hands and just keep developing the nuance of his game. If Slayton can emerge as a consistent WR1/2, then the Giants pass catching group becomes much stronger.

**OL:**

>Once again, I was too hopeful last year; I said the OL would take a step forward and they pretty much did the opposite. Nate Solder was quite bad, Will Hernandez didn't take a step forward, Jon Halapio was serviceable at best, Kevin Zeitler was pretty good, and Mike Remmers was an admirable stopgap.  
>  
>I don't want to get my hopes up that it'll be way better this year, but hopefully it will. The addition of Andrew Thomas as hopefully a day 1 high end starter should already be a massive upgrade; if he can be a blindside protector for Jones, who is often oblivious to backside pressure, then the Giants can move Nate Solder to the right side, where Jones' mobility can help make him look better. And with better coaching hopefully from Marc Colombo, there is room for the Giants OL to improve; Hernandez could take the step forward we are hoping for and Zeitler and Solder can potentially reach their peak again.  
>  
>The biggest challenge for the Giants OL is finding a competent center; it'll be a wide open camp battle, and a weak center position could be this OL's Achilles heel. The other interesting thing will be which of the 3 (or 4) tackles earn starting roster spots. The expectation is it will be Thomas and Solder, with the sides as of yet to be decided, but the Giants also added Matt Peart, who, depending on his development and transition from UConn, could take control of the ""RT of the Future"" spot as soon as training camp. Nick Gates wasn't terrible last year in some spot starts at RT (though it sounds like they'll focus on him training at center) so he's a potential option as well.

**DL:**

>This should be a major strength of an otherwise questionable defense. Pretty much everyone has the same expectation; strong run defenders, but they need to show more of the pass rush production. For Dexter Lawrence, this is just the next phase in his devlopment. For BJ Hill, that's a necessary step for him to prove he deserves a roster spot and more playing time moving forward. For Leonard Williams and Dalvin Tomlinson, that would bolster their future payday. I expect Tomlinson to get something like what DJ Reader signed for this offseason (probably not from the Giants, who, according to some, were shopping Tomlinson aggressively at the trade deadline and at the draft before deciding he was worth more to them than the offers they got), while Williams will shoot for as much as he can. It was reported in the last week or so that [Williams was seeking $18m-20m](https://sny.tv/articles/giants-mailbag-on-the-futures-of-leonard-williams-and-markus-golden) and that's a price the Giants (and probably every other team in the NFL) have absolutely zero interest in paying; so he's likely walking next year.

**EDGE:**

>This is, I think, the weakest group on the Giants roster this season, which is really disappointing given how dominant pass rushes have been a major piece of the Giants' identity when they were good.  
>  
>Kyler Fackrell is a one year flier stopgap, there should be no real expectations of him; we can't rule out a Shaq Barrett-esque season but there's no way I'd put money on it. This is Lorenzo Carter's last real shot at breaking out, as we've been hoping he would put two and two together and put his raw ability to good use, but that hasn't happened and many Giants fans are losing hope. It seems that the Giants are expecting Markus Golden back on that UFA tender (when this is posted, it will be around 10 days before the deadline for that) since no other teams have stepped up and made offers despite knowing this tender is on him. And Oshane Ximines flashed a couple of times but was invisible the rest of the time. If he can break out, that would be really big for the Giants, but overall, I'm expecting no one to break double digit sacks.

**LB:**

>Expectations for this group are really hard; it really hinges on Ryan Connelly. Connelly, another 5th round pick of the Giants in 2020, had a really strong start to the year before tearing his ACL a quarter of the way through the season. If he comes back fully healthy and can build off of that early success, this group looks a lot better. Martinez will probably be a solid contributor against the run, especially with the guys up front being really effective at opening holes for him. Hopefully one of these guys can add some coverage ability to their repertoire this season.

**Secondary:**

>This group, for the most part, is in the same position it was last year; One vet CB out (Janoris Jenkins) and one in (James Bradberry), but still a group of relative babies behind them; Almost every DB on the roster besides Bradberry is on a rookie contract (with ST specialist Nate Ebner being the only other exception). Overall, the Giants need breakout years from at least some of these players. Jabrill Peppers has been serviceable for the Giants, but outside of a few splash plays like forced fumbles or a pick six, I think he has been fairly forgettable. DeAndre Baker struggled early in the year but did improve down the stretch; he needs to really build on that. The rest of the CB room needs to just get on the field and be productive; Sam Beal is entering his 3rd year but has barely played. Darnay Holmes hopefully will be the day 1 starter in the slot, but don't expect him to be lockdown from jump. Xavier McKinney is the wildcard of this group; if he can generate some turnovers or be a more effective safety net over the top, it could really help this group look better, instead of leaving the CBs exposed on an island.

# Training Camp Battles

Training camp battles will be big for the Giants, because HC Joe Judge has made numerous comments about how the best players will play; incumbency is out the window.

* **Center**

>This will be a four-way battle probably; incumbent Jon Halapio, backup Spencer Pulley, Swiss Army Knife Nick Gates, and draftee Shane Lemieux. Halapio and Pulley have the upper hand, since they've both played C in NFL games before. Gates has been trained at every position along the OL, and C is probably his best shot to crack the starting lineup. Lemieux was just drafted, and I don't think the goal is for him to start at C, but they will train him at C, and if they decide he's the best option he'll start. The C position is probably the biggest reason Giants fans are really unhappy with the Leonard Williams trade; the 3rd rounder the Giants spent trading for Williams could have been used on a center prospect like Matt Hennessy or Lloyd Cushenberry, who probably are day 1 starters at that position.

* **OT**

>The big question here is where the tackles will start. The most likely scenario is that 4th overall pick Andrew Thomas and Nate Solder will start at tackle, but who starts where will be decided in camp. My money is on Andrew Thomas on the left and Nate Solder on the right; LT is Thomas' long term home, while Solder will most likely not be on the roster next year (his 2021 cap hit is scheduled to be 20.5m while the Giants would save 14m by releasing him). The big question here is just how good Solder will be in camp; I love Matt Peart, but I don't expect him to perform better in camp than Solder. I can't rule it out, though.

* **EDGE**

>With or without Markus Golden back in the fold, the EDGE group has to shake out somehow. If Golden is back, he'll probably take one starting spot. But how Carter, Ximines, and Fackrell shake out is a complete mystery. This will be purely who looks the best in camp.

* **Slot CB**

>Darnay Holmes should be the leader in the clubhouse at this position, but the Giants have a wealth of unproven young CBs. Sam Beal is still an option, though he profiles better on the outside, and Grant Haley and Corey Ballantine are both still potential options.

Heading into the 1999 NFC championship game between the Bucs and Rams, the Rams had the #1 scoring offense averaging 32.9 ppg while the Bucs had the #3 scoring defense only giving up 14.7 ppg.

However, at home, the Rams had averaged 36.6 ppg when you include the 49 points that they had scored against the Vikings in the divisional round.

In this game, the Bucs defense only gave up 9 points to the Greatest Show on Turf.

2 of the points scored by the Rams was due to a safety as a result of a high snap from Bucs center Tony Mayberry that went over Shaun King's head and into the end zone.

The Bucs defense held Kurt Warner for the game to 26/43 for 258 yards, 1 touchdown, 3 interceptions, and a QB rating of 56.2.

In fact, with just 10 minutes left in the 4th quarter and the Bucs offense on the field, the Bucs defense had held the Rams offense to just 3 points not counting the safety given up by the Bucs offense.

The Bucs had a 6-5 lead until Shaun King threw an interception around the 9:20 mark in the fourth quarter which gave the Rams offense the ball near the Bucs 47 yards line.

The Rams would score a touchdown with 4:50 left in the game to go up 11-6 with a failed two point conversion.

The Bucs offense would drive down the field and then the Bert Emanuel controversy happened and they would turn it over on 4th down.

Shaun King ended the game 13/29 for 163, 0 touchdown, 2 ints, and a QB rating of 34.1.

When you consider the fact that the Rams were a historically great offense playing at home in a dome, would you say that the Bucs defensive performance was the greatest wasted performance in a playoff game?

Growing up I was told the Redskins were named after my great-grandfather and the other Native American players and coach. His name was [Louis ""Rabbit"" Weller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Weller) and he was an incredible athlete.

&nbsp;

[George Preston Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Preston_Marshall), the owner at the time, changed the name from the Boston Braves to the Boston Redskins in 1933 for [reasons](https://imgur.com/AkrWc0E). He claims he did not choose Redskins because of the ""Indians"" on the team. Rather, he hoped the team could keep the Native American moniker. Why he chose Redskins, specifically, I do not know (If anyone does, please share).

&nbsp;

I do not have a firm stance on the name change because, honestly, I do not know how I feel. So, rather than shame people or decisions made a long time ago I'd like to honor a transcendent Native American athlete.

&nbsp;

Louis ""Rabbit"" Weller is my hero. He died on the golf course, on the 17th hole. He was 75 and probably 4 under. He could hoop, too. James Naismith said he was the best dribbler he had ever seen. Grandpa Lou claims that they even changed one of the rules because it was too easy for him to get buckets.

&nbsp;

His football accolades are insane. He was called ""Rabbit"" because he was that hard to tackle. The name was given to him by sports writers, one of which called him ""the greatest broken-field runner the midwest had ever seen"". He was the HB but also a monster return specialist. He was even featured on Ripley's Believe It Or Not for a 105-yard kick return. His career is summed up [here](https://imgur.com/DZ3Of7C).

&nbsp;

He's my namesake. He was a phenomenal athlete. By all accounts, he was a great guy because my great-grandma was the sweetest person I had ever met and she chose to be with Louis Weller.

&nbsp;

## Coaching Changes

As the marketing says, this is a new Riv**ERA**. Almost the entire coaching staff has been replaced, except for the running back and special teams coaches, so let's all give a hand to Randy Jordan and Nate Kaczor for being survivors of the Rivera purge. Here are the highlights:

&nbsp;

#### **Head Coach**: Ron Rivera replaces interim Bill Callahan


After an 0-5 start last season, and multiple season of mediocrity, Dan Snyder finally decided to pull the plug on Jay Gruden. Interim coach Bill Callahan did a...job. The question quickly turned to who would be the newest coach of the Washington Football Franchise. Would it be current OC and potential wünderkid Kevin O'Connell? Would they somehow steal away Mike Tomlin (remember this theory?) No. Enter in: *Riverboat Ron*.


Ironically, the only way that Washington was able to hire him was by defeating him: in week 13 of the 2019 season, Adrian Peterson and Derrius Guice stomped through Rivera's defense to the tune of 248 yards on the [ground](https://www.espn.com/nfl/matchup?gameId=401128032). That was enough to seal his fate with owner David Tepper, who was vocal through the season about the panthers status of [mediocrity](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28110486/panthers-owner-david-tepper-frustrated-latest-loss-says-accept-long-term-mediocrity).


While one can reflect on Rivera's tenure as mediocrity, I'd argue it is anything but. As 2-time Head Coach of the Year, Rivera lead the Panthers to 3 1st place finishes in the NFC South, including a historic 15-1 2015 season where the Panthers made it to the Super Bowl behind MVP Cam Newton. Rivera is the winningest coach in Panthers history, with an overall record of 76-63-1. However, he was not Tepper's choice, and for that as a fan I owe Tepper one. 


While I would not fault Jay Gruden for all of the Redskins issues the past 5 1/2 years, he seemed destined to stay at most mediocre, never even reaching the highs Rivera has seen. Key Gruden personnel such as Kirk Cousins, Jordan Reed, Chris Thompson, Josh Norman, Josh Doctson, and more are long gone. Rivera has a brand new cast to work with, and I am excited to see it.


Rivera is a proven head coach with a long and public track record. He is known for being a big believer in a strong player-oriented team culture, and god *knows* this team needs some major culture help, especially in the front office. Looking at you, [Mr. Snyder](https://deadspin.com/dan-snyders-dickhead-behavior-is-a-complex-thing-1494990621). **GRADE: A**

&nbsp;

#### **Offensive Coordinator**: Scott Turner replaces Kevin O'Connell


Losing Kevin O'Connell to the Rams is disappointing, no way around it in my mind. Could the Rams get bitten in the rear and throw a green coordinator into the wind? Maybe. But out of all personnel we didn't keep, this one stung the most. 

However, one must not dwell on the past too much. Enter in Scott Turner, son of Norv Turner. Turner comes over from Carolina where he was first the QB coach under his father, and then suddenly replaced his father once Rivera was fired. Some highlights of Turner include: 

* Being the Brown's receiver coach during Josh Gordon's monstrous 2013 season
* Vikings QB coach during Teddy Bridgewater's best years 

Yeah that's about it. He is young and hungry, and honestly, I am pretty happy with this choice as well. I have faith in him to develop Haskins, who is the future of the franchise as of now. Hopefully he does not fall out of favor as his father did with our favorite [owner](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100127&page=1). **GRADE: B+**

&nbsp;

#### Defensive Coordinator: Jack Del Rio replaces Greg Manusky

The Redskins defense in my opinion has been underwhelming in recent times, and in large part I blame Greg Manusky for this result. The Redskins defense last year ranked 27th overall, which any Washington fan will tell you is at best a slight shame and at worst a goddamn tragedy. Sure, our secondary was nowhere to be seen. Sure, we we're extremely [injured a lot of the time.](https://redskinswire.usatoday.com/2019/12/24/redskins-injuries-visualization-2020/) 

But here's the worst part: our front 7 is actually really good. I mean come on: Jonathan Allen, Daron Payne, Matt Ioannidis, Ryan Kerrigan, Montez Sweat, and more should amount to one of the most potent QB rushing attacks of the year. However, the stats show that this is just not true. PFF listed us outside the [top ten](https://www.pff.com/news/pro-nfl-front-seven-rankings-all-32-teams-after-17-weeks) and in a more general sense the defense overall just seems too ooze [mediocrity](https://www.lineups.com/nfl-team-rankings/defense#whatdefensehasthemostsacksin2019).

Enter in Jack Del Rio. This man has over 30 years of NFL experience, having multiple positions as both Head Coach and Defensive Coordinators in the past. While his head coaching career has not always been consistent, his defensive strengths are quite apparent. While Wade Phillips was responsible for the Super Bowl winning Broncos of 2015, we cannot forget that Del Rio groomed that defense for years prior, bringing them to the big game as well the year before. His earlier success in Baltimore and Carolina must also be mentioned, but my main point is this: Jack Del Rio is *tiers* above Manusky.

Del Rio and Rivera are on the same page, and switching to a 4-3 base defense with Del Rio should pay dividends to our defense, particularly our front seven. Look for a strong pass rush with Del Rio under control. **GRADE: A**

&nbsp;

#### Quarterbacks Coach: Ken Zampese replaces Tim Rattay

Zampese formerly worked for the Greatest Show on Turf helping Kurt Warner, Isaac Bruce, and Torry Holt achieve offensive supremacy over the league. He worked for 12 years in Cincinnati, developing both Carson Palmer and Andy Dalton. In addition, he helped to develop Baker his rookie year under literal the dumpster fire of a head coaching regime Hue Jackson had in 2018. After seeing many of Haskins sexy throws to McLaurin, Gandy-Golden and Co. on Instagram, I feel some safety in the QB department for once. **GRADE: A-** 

&nbsp;

#### Head Athletic Trainer: Ryan Vermillion replaces Larry Hess

If there's one thing that reminds me of a Washington Football season, its injuries. While Washington was not the only injured team, it definitely felt like one of the worst [last year](https://redskinswire.usatoday.com/2020/01/29/injuries-league-wide-problem-in-nfl/). At the end of the day, the blame falls on random injury luck, proper practice, and the athletic training staff. Larry Hess had been employed by Washington for 17 years, so this move may be seen as a long time coming, especially concerning some of the particularly bad injuries of recent years.  

Vermillion has rep with Rivera, as he is the former head trainer for the Panthers. While the Panthers have had some injury troubles of there own as of recently, I am still hopeful that Vermillion and his staff can help the situation over here. **GRADE: B**

## Free Agency

**Players lost/cut**

Player | Position | New team
---------|----------|----------
Chris Thompson | RB | Jaguars
Colt McCoy | QB | Giants
Case Keenum | QB | Browns
Ereck Flowers | OG | Dolphins
Josh Norman | CB | Bills
Trent Williams | OT | 49ers
Montae Nicholson | CB | UFA
Jordan Reed | TE | UFA
Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie | CB | UFA
Wendell Smallwood | RB | UFA
Tony Bergstrom | OL | UFA
Donald Penn | OT | UFA
Vernon Davis | TE | Retired


**Key Losses:**

* Ereck Flowers: Flowers had been written off as a bust. His tenure in New York and Jacksonville were both at best mediocre, and at worst disgusting. He gave up tons of pressures, and questions about his [devotion](https://247sports.com/nfl/new-york-giants/Article/ex-New-York-Giants-Geoff-Schwartz-slams-Ereck-Flowers-for-effort-on-tape-117419710/) to the team were at play. However, Washington was able to reignite Flowers by transitioning him from a tackle to a guard. In this new role, he only allowed two sacks while starting all 16 games. In the end, he was able to get the best pay-day back home in Miami, and for that I cannot hold any ill-will.

&nbsp;

* Josh Norman: [5 years. $51.1 million guaranteed. $75 million total.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/15306513/josh-norman-signs-washington-redskins) Honestly, I believed in Josh Norman when we first signed him. Coming off an All-Pro year on a stacked 2015 Panthers roster, Norman was proud to declare himself the best corner in the whole league. If you'd ask Norman today, he may still very well [agree](https://247sports.com/nfl/washington-redskins/Article/Josh-Norman-still-a-top-cornerback--132672800/#:~:text=Washington%20Redskins%20cornerback%20Josh%20Norman,best%20cornerbacks%20in%20the%20game.) with that assessment. However, both the film and numbers point to Norman as a one year wonder. He was never able to replicate his 2015 success here, and was barely able to follow receivers like Revis or play the zone like Sherman. I would consider this the worst Redskins free agent signing of the Jay Gruden regime, hands down bar none. At least Matt Jones gave us some 100 yard games. His best games for us were against Cody Kessler and Matt Barkley. I am glad this is over with.

&nbsp;

* Trent Williams: [Oh Trent-y boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling.](https://www.si.com/nfl/redskins/news/goodbye-trent) I am truly sad to see Mr. Williams suit up for another organization this fall, assuming there will be a football season. Trent has been one of, if not the **best** offensive lineman in the entire NFL since being drafted 4th overall in 2010. Even as poor football and asinine front office moves surrounded him, Trent remained grounded and supportive of Mr. Snyder's hope to win football games. However, this relationship quickly turned for the worse. I could write this whole page about the Trent Williams saga, so instead I shall link [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/in-trent-williams-vs-the-redskins-it-used-to-be-easy-to-pick-a-side-not-anymore/2020/03/25/a256e6d4-6ebe-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html). 

[Goodbye Silverback.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOCL3nxkmC0)

&nbsp;

* Jordan Reed: If you thought the Trent Williams saga hurt me, oh boy you are not ready for this. Jordan Reed was probably my favorite Washington player up until last season. I was at his first [big game](https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2013/10/20/4858558/redskins-bears-2013-results-score) in 2013, and boy was it a sight to see. A 3rd round TE from Florida, Reed was a bright spot on a more distant 3-13 Washington Squad still hoping for RG3's knees to spring back to life. When Reed was on fire, he was **on**. In his heyday of 2015 and 2016, Reed was a top tier Pro-Bowl talent TE possessing the quickness of a WR with the strength and build of a TE. However, we all know how this story ends. In 2013, he only played 9 games due to concussions. In 2014, he hurt his hamstring twice throughout the season yet still played in 11 games. As stated earlier, 15' and 16' were the golden years, but his hamstring came back to derail almost his entire 2017 season. By last year, he had over 9 known concussions, and one can only assume his hamstring is not in good shape. This is a classic example of injuries destroying a once promising career. If you are ever in need of watching some electrifying tight end plays, check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNQ3VWK2KeE) out, I promise you will not regret it. Thank you Jordan!

Jeremy Vujnovich | OG | Cardinals | 1 year | $825k
Ronald Darby | CB | Eagles | 1 year |$3 mil, $1 mil guaranteed
Mike Liedtke | OG | Buccaneers | 1 year | $750k

**Key Additions:**

* Kendall Fuller: We are proud to welcome our 2016 3rd rounder and new Super Bowl Champion back to DC. Fuller has proven himself as a formidable slot cornerback, and should be a day 1 starter immediately. In fact, I could see us playing him on the outside if need be, as our secondary will become stretched dry rather quickly. If we can trade for Malik Jefferson, we could finally have all pieces of the Alex Smith trade back on the roster, including Alex Smith himself (hang in there buddy :( ). 

&nbsp;

* Thomas Davis: A 3x Pro Bowler and bonafide former team leader of the Carolina Panthers, Thomas Davis is a welcome addition to our locker room. While at age 37 he may not start or play the most downs, his presence and familiarity with Rivera lends kindly to helping younger defensive players adjust and learn the new system.

&nbsp;

* Ronald Darby: Darby has never played a full 16 game season, and the past two seasons in particular seem to be injury ridden. However, our secondary is in need of a #2 to step up behind Fuller and if Moreau cannot make a leap then Darby better be a frog. This one year, prove-it deal will show whether or not Darby is ready to [play with the big boys now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLomnZIvoFs).

**Players resigned**

Player | Position | Length | Salary
---------|----------|----------|----------
Jon Bostic | LB | 2 year | $5.1 mil, $2.25 mil guaranteed
Caleb Brantley | DT | 1 year | $750k
Nate Orchard | LB/DE | 1 year | $1 mil, $137.5k guaranteed
Aaron Colvin | CB | 1 year | $1 mil, $137.5k guaranteed
Brandon Scherff | OG | 1 year | $15.03 mil guaranteed (franchise tag) 

**Important Resigns:**

* Jon Bostic: The former 2nd rounder has bounced around the league since 2013, but with Reuben Foster tearing his ACL in training camp last year, Bostic was thrust into the starting LB slot. While far from perfect, Bostic played surprisingly well last year, recording 105 tackles, a sack, and a pick. It is unclear whether Bostic's ceiling is much higher then this going into year 8 of his career. The signing of Thomas Davis and an even better D-Line could help Bostic shine more as there is less pressure on him. Overall, a good team friendly extension on a starter/1st off the bench quality player.

&nbsp;

* Brandon Scherff: Except for some penalty troubles, Scherff has been the most consistent offensive lineman this team has had in the past five years who is not upset at our current front office. While I am unsure if he was worthy of the Pro Bowl this past year, he is a stud OG and I am glad we have kept him his whole rookie deal. Hopefully a long-term can be worked out soon (though the deadline may have just past for franchise tagees), but keeping him on the franchise tag is far down the list of personnel issues.

UDFA | N/A | Steven Montez | QB | Colorado
UDFA | N/A | Isaiah Wright | WR | Temple
UDFA | N/A | Johnathon Johnson | WR | Missouri

**Grades and Thoughts:**

* Chase Young: How much more can be said about this guy? Young was known for months to be the consensus number one talent of the draft, and that has not changed in the past months. He is a forced to be reckoned with, and putting him alongside our other D-Lineman is a scary sight. The often made comparison is that of the Bosa brothers, who both came into the league and wrecked havoc upon entry. I see Young doing the same thing, having a minimum 10+ sack season. Fear the predator y'all. **GRADE: A+**

&nbsp;

* Antonio Gibson: Almost every analysis I have read about Gibson describes him in one of two ways: 1) A swiss-army knife 2) A football player. While I can't disagree with either, these both seem to be big buzzwords that cable football analysis loves to float around to tons and tons of players. No matter how you describe him, Gibson's highlight real speaks for itself. Most project him into a RB role in our system, and with Chris Thompson setting sail with Jay Gruden Gibson can not pick up the slack here. If he can provide support to Peterson and Guice, great! If he could improve our dismal receiving unit, even better! I like this pick, but can also see it failing if Rivera and Turner cannot utilize him correctly. **GRADE: B+** 

&nbsp;

* Saahdiq Charles: Using a picks here on the O-Line was a smart move, as our bench before the draft was extremely thin. Charles has been a part of one of the best O-line's in the nation at LSU, helping Clyde Edwards-Helaire run over the entire goddamn SEC. While there was a distraction of off-field issues, i.e. his six game suspension in his junior year. My understanding is that this stemmed from maturity issues and possible failed drug tests. Without these concerns, Charles would not have fallen to this round. Even with the character issue, his on the field product is fantastic, and if there was any coach to help Charles stay the right path it would be Ron Rivera. **GRADE: B**

&nbsp;

* Antonio Gandy-Golden: My information on Gandy-Golden and Liberty football in general is extremely limited, but the little I have seen is fantastic. At 6'4, 223 lbs Gandy-Golden is prototypical size and his highlights at Liberty reflect that. He is able to utilize is wingspan to have a large catch radius and contend for aired out balls. In addition, while his 4.6 40 yard dash may be slightly underwhelming, his speed on tape is evident and can work. As the receiver competition is wide open, Gandy-Golden can easily become the number two receiver on this squad if he puts in the work. And according to social media, it appears [he is trying.](https://redskinswire.usatoday.com/2020/07/11/watch-antonio-gandy-golden-shows-off-one-handed-catch-working-with-dwayne-haskins/) **GRADE: A**

&nbsp;

* Keith Ismael: Another offensive linemen, but I struggle to see Ismael in any role besides backup this year. Ismael was solid player for his three year college career, and learning behind our O-line can do him well to bring him up to NFL speed. I can see him sitting behind Rouiller most of the year, but there's always the potential for something more if he is a diamond in the rough. However, I would have liked for a TE selection here. **GRADE: B**

&nbsp;

* Kamren Curl: Curl seemed to be an intrenched starter for Arkansas, but it is hard to see what is exactly unique with his skill set. At 6'1, 206 lbs he has the body of a safety or even cornerback, which tracks as he played both positions in school. The most known information about him is that he was [suspended for flirting with a cheerleader](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2806824-arkansas-dbs-kamren-curl-ryan-pulley-suspended-for-flirting-with-cheerleaders) his sophomore season, but if that is his biggest character concern then I don't really care. In addition, he later cleared the confusion, noting that the cheerleader just [wanted a photo with him.](https://twitter.com/TheHogSty/status/1254407872496259072) **GRADE: C**

&nbsp;

* James Smith-Williams: A depth signing for our defensive front, which is all good in my book. However, this [deep dive](https://www.hogshaven.com/2020/4/29/21241272/james-smith-williams-is-an-athletic-freak-who-could-prove-to-be-defensive-line-depth) into the man shows that Smith-Williams has the potential to be more then a name in DC. His injury history is very troubling, but if he can put that Big Bang Theory Sheldon brain of his to our team then I am all for it. 7th rounders are the time for risks, and Smith-Williams case is a unique one where the injuries are not as much a concern for me. **GRADE: C+**

&nbsp;

If the only player we keep out of this draft in the next 5 years is Chase Young, it will still have been a success. However, I have a feeling that other players will make an impact here, particularly with Gibson or Gandy-Golden breaking out in a rushing or receiving competition. For Kyle Smith and Rivera's first draft, it could have gone a lot worse. The amount of BS spewed about us drafting Tua or trading down was EVERYWHERE online before the draft, so I am jus glad we didn't mess it up as bad as we could have. Overall, I'd rate this draft a **B+**, with the rating going higher if any of these other players break out as well.

## Name Controversy

Look, both you and I know that this subject has been beaten to death, especially on this subreddit. So let us just establish the facts:

* There has been ample push to change the name since the [1990s.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/sports/dc-sports-bog/2020/07/13/amp-stories/timeline-redskins-name-change-debate/)

* Dan Snyder said in 2013 that he would never change the name. [""It's that simple. NEVER — you can use caps.""](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2013/05/09/washington-redskins-daniel-snyder/2148127/)

* This month, Fedex, along with other major sponsors such as Nike and PepsiCo called on Snyder to change their name or face financial [doom](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/redskins-name-change-sponsors-washington/1vvijznbnnven1it7zsvwfbz8c).

* July 13, 2020 Snyder issues a press release stating the name and logo are both [officially retired](https://twitter.com/Redskins/status/1282661063943651328).

There are many more specifics and points of contention on this issue, and I think this [WaPo graphic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/sports/dc-sports-bog/2020/07/13/amp-stories/timeline-redskins-name-change-debate/) does a good job illustrating other key times that the name has been discussed or been a point of contention. 

My thought? About damn time. Look, I understand that the name is offensive and have been all for changing it, but more importantly I just want us to focus on what **ideally** should be more pressing for this writeup: the players and the game. The politics of the name has been a distraction and disgrace to the proud men who have worn this city on their back for decades. Do not get me wrong: the actual name itself holds little meaning to me personally. However, I am younger than many fans of the team and understand the attachment some have had for their entire lives. Yet, I do not think we need to forget about Theismann, Baugh, Jurgensen, Doug Williams, Rypien, Riggins, the Hogs, and more just by retiring the name. I say, let this begin a new era in Washington football history where we can be remembered for playing a game we enjoy and love, not hurting others if we do not need to.

My personal preference for a new name as of now is Red Wolves. Maintaining the colors and HttR (Howl to the Red Wolves!) sounds nice, and the animal is theoretically indigenous to DC and the southeast US even as we may not see it commonly. If trademarks issues can settle, I believe we will hear the new name before the next season.

## Sexual Harassment/Misconduct Issues

After finishing the [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/16/redskins-sexual-harassment-larry-michael-alex-santos/?arc404=true) today, I was left with a feeling of disgust and sadness, but not shock. Football has always been known as a ""boy's club,"" and seeing women in positions of power in any NFL organization is not common. This is the reason why. While I do not know the situation of every front office, I would not be shocked if this is more common then one would suspect. 

Now, do not get me wrong: this is disgusting and Snyder should be ashamed of himself. Letting this persist for over 20 years and clearly not giving any shits is despicable. I do not want to defend these actions in any manner. These men have done disgusting things, and the fact that Snyder has let them slide and persist for all this time is plain gross. This is a question about human decency and respect: do you respect your fellow person enough that you control what you say around them? That you think before you act? Clearly the Washington Football team has **not** cared about its female employees nearly enough. This is hurtful for everyone, male, female, non-binary, whatever. Please, just consider your fellow person when you are living your life. This is not hard.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Projected Lineup and Position Groups

&nbsp;

Offense:

QB1: Dwayne Haskins

QB2: Kyle Allen


This should be Dwayne Haskins year to fully realize himself as a starting quarterback in the NFL. While I love watching his sexy instagram workouts, I can only get so worked up before needing to see the real deal. Since being thrown into the fray last year, we saw Dwayne progress in his decision making, but keep improvements in accuracy, particularly throwing mechanics, should be a focus this year. Even with a...subpar supporting cast (more on that later), this should be Simba's year to *break out*, or at least show that he is worthy of his first round draft selection. 

I don't expect Allen or even Alex Smith (if he has recovered enough, which I am doubtful of) to give Haskins a run for his money. While Rivera has never stated he is sold on Haskins, do not think any other QB will start this season (barring injury.) Washington is committed, at least for this year, to Dwayne Haskins.

&nbsp;

RB1: Adrian Peterson/Derrius Guice

RB3: Antonio Gibson

It is really a toss-up here whether or not AD or Guice starts, but if history is cyclical then Peterson will get the nod soon enough. I **really** want Guice to do well, and when he has not been injured he has done fairly well. However, I have little hope that his knees keep holding up, especially considering how much we may need to rely on our run game this year. 

Peterson is old, but has shown to be consistent enough when we have a semblance of an offensive line. Our run game is decent, definitely not the worst in the league, but could be close to it. I imagine Gibson may fulfill the role of a receiver back, catching out of the backfield or taking hand-offs. He is bigger than Chris Thompson, but elusive enough that I could see some similarity in usage, especially as a rookie.

&nbsp;

TE1: Jeremy Sprinkle

TE2: Richard Rogers, Logan Thomas

TE3: Thaddeus Moss

Sprinkle gets the nod here as the number one due to his experience in DC, but as the new regime is in town this is really anyone's game. Stat-wise Rogers and Thomas are relatively consistent, and while Moss has the obvious name recognition he is not even a lock to make the current roster. Sprinkle has always been subpar as a pass catcher, decent as blocker and not much else. Hopefully someone here breaks out or a trade swings through, otherwise this is one of our worst position groups on the roster.

&nbsp;

WR1: Terry McLaurin

WR2: Steven Sims Jr. 

WR3: Antonio Gandy-Golden/Cody Latimer

WR4: Trey Quinn

""McLaurin and then everybody else"" is the best way to sum up our receiving unit. Scary Terry is once again our biggest threat and should have just as good if not a better year than 2019 as Haskins' accuracy issues (hopefully) clear up. I Like Sims Jr. as a returner, but his results as a receiver have been inconsistent. Perhaps he could be used similarly to Antonio Gibson, as I see him getting end around hand offs having big success. Gandy-Golden looks promising, but small school talent can be hard to adapt to the NFL. Latimer is a solid depth signing, and I am very unsure if Trey Quinn is worth his roster spot. While I mentioned the Tight End group being poor, this group is equal in that regard. Hopefully our run game can carry once again.

&nbsp;

LT: Geron Christian Sr.

LG: Wes Schweitzer

C: Chase Roullier

RG: Brandon Scherff

RT: Morgan Moses

Scherff is a bright spot on this mediocre group, but he has had some penalty troubles and the contract situation for him is still unclear as for the future. Geron Christian should hopefully start and have improved since last year, and Schweitzer seems to be a decent signing. I like Rouiller under center for now. Saahdiq Charles and Keith Ismael could both become starters, but I have a feeling Rivera will not want to throw them into the fire early on. Overall I'd categorize this group as ""eh?"" and hope that our RBs can find enough holes. Haskins has also been improving his mobile game so escapability could be a needed factor with this line.

&nbsp;

4-3 Defense:

LDE1: Chase Young

LDT: Matt Ioannidis

RDT: Daron Payne

RDE: Montez Sweat

This is **by far** the best position group on the entire roster. Calling these four the only starters is somewhat a misnomer, as Rivera and Del Rio will be frequently subbing in and out many linemen. Kerrigan and Jon Allen should still have large roles, but these are my choices based on durability and past success. Chase Young should be a stud, and I have heard him having between 10-15 sacks this year. Ioannidis has been a 5th round gem for us, leading the team in sacks last year. Payne and Sweat are both young and have shown some success, and I am hopeful they can both remain at worst starter level linemen. If our line is not getting after QBs like crazy this year, some big questions will need to be raised.

&nbsp;

WLB: Cole Holcomb, Josh Harvey-Clemons

MLB: Jon Bostic, Thomas Davis

SLB: Ryan Anderson

While not as impressive as the linemen, our LB core is still a solid group. Thomas Davis brings in some leadership to an otherwise young group. Ryan Anderson will finally be playing in his natural position as a 4-3 LB. Both Bostic and Holcomb were impressive last year, though I am hoping their coverage (particularly Holcomb's) could improve. Harvey-Clemons is good for our depth, and solid rotation player. Overall not a flashy group, but should get the job done with the pressure all being up front.

&nbsp;

CB1: Kendall Fuller

CB2: Ronald Darby, Greg Stroman

CB3: Fabian Moreau, Jimmy Moreland

FS: Sean Davis

SS: Landon Collins

The only unquestionable starters here are Fuller and Collins, and even Collins has been looking down as of recent. My dark-horse candidate is Jimmy Moreland, who impressed in last years preseason before being hidden or unnoticeable during the regular season. Moreau is decent, and Sean Davis is as good as Montae Nicholson ever was (especially considering his legal issues.) The loss of Quinton Dunbar is not sad whatsoever, and while his play was above-average, his robbery skills are very poor. This is the biggest whole in the defense by far, and my guess is that our team will ride or die by this secondary. If the front 7 is doing what it can to apply pressure, there will be some slack here. However, do not be surprised if next years writeup has many different players here.

&nbsp;

Special Teams:

K: Dustin Hopkins

P: Tress Way

KR: Steven Sims Jr.

PR: Steven Sims Jr.

I want Tress Way to have my children so that they will be blessed with his punting genes. After a couple years of flying under the radar, Way was finally recognized in 2019 with a Pro Bowl and Second-team All-Pro nod. I am upset that Brett Kern got the nod over him for First-team, but the recognition is still appreciated. Hopkins is decent, though he does have a tendency to miss some close kicks (*cough* [vs. Bengals in London](https://youtu.be/dbsOJSW1Ro0?t=329) *cough*), but he has provided stability to kicking for years now. Sims emerged last year as our return man, and with him bringing us our first return touchdown since 2015, I'll let him stay. Perhaps Gibson will try returning as well, who knows. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Schedule Prediction

&nbsp;

Home against the Eagles: **Loss**

3 out of the past 4 years Washington has lost its openers, with two of those loses being against the Eagles themselves. Be ready for growing pains with a new name, coaching staff, and supporting cast. This season is not gonna get any easier.

&nbsp;

Away against the Cardinals: **Loss**

This game could be a close one, but the Cardinals seem to be on the up with Kyler and Kingsbury. There air raid will be too much for the DC secondary, especially playing in Arizona.

&nbsp;

Away against the Browns: **Win**

It's the Browns for god sake. Josh Norman had a game winning pick a couple years back for us against them. Sure, their QB was Cody Kessler, but different year same stories. No more Freddie Kitchens, still the same Browns.

&nbsp;

Home against the Ravens: **Loss**

It's the Ravens. Enough said.

&nbsp;

Home against the Rams: **Loss**

McVay and Co. should have our number here. Even without Gurley the Rams passing attack should be enough to take us down. The real downfall of our team is the secondary, that should be a pattern to notice. I'd like to believe in a Haskins comeback win here, but who knows.

&nbsp;

Away against the Giants: **Loss**

Going into the Meadowlands, I expect a game similar to the late OT thriller of last season, with the Daniel Jones reigning supreme again. Saquon will distract our defense enough that number one receiver... Sterling Shepard will bust us up. Clap man Garett gets us again.

&nbsp;

Home against the Cowboys: **Win**

Come on now, it's the Cowboys. Dak is overpaid, blah blah blah. Coming back home and wanting to prove ourselves after a crippling loss last week, I think Simba can pull off a nice home win here.

&nbsp;

Home against the Giants: **Win**

Revenge game of the 2019 QBs, and this time Haskins will stay on top. Expect a nice performance from McLaurin, and Chase Young destroying Mr. Jones. 

&nbsp;

Away against the Lions: **Win**

I'm praying that Chase Young is able to get after Stafford enough that he does not pull a come back against us here, but I expect this game to be close as well. Perhaps Okudah has a pick six, why not.

&nbsp;

Home against the Bengals: **Win**

Haskins vs. Burrow. Burrow vs. Young. A bonafide 2019 tank-bowl matchup. I feel we have the upper hand here, but really this game should be a shit show. Should be juicy though.

&nbsp;

Away against the Cowboys: **Loss**

Playing in Jerry World is ass, though I'll never forget Colt McCoy leading us to victory on Monday night. No way in hell we go 2-0 against the Cowboys, so mark this down as a loss.

&nbsp;

Away against the Steelers: **Loss**

Big Ben is back and can run around in the pocket, meaning even with ample pressure his offense will do better than ours.

&nbsp;

Away against the 49ers: **Loss**

It's the Niners, and they mean business. Last year's game was a 9-0 snoozefest for some reason, so I'm guessing this one will be 30-27 shootout. Should be fun to see a potential Trent Williams vs. Chase Young matchup. 

&nbsp;

Home against the Seahawks: **Loss**

Russell Wilson.

&nbsp;

Home against the Panthers: **Win**

Rivera fights his old team and...wins?? Yep, even with Teddy B I feel our defense will keep us afloat. Shaq Thompson is scary, but I am not particularly afraid of Donte Jackson and Eli Apple... Haskins will now probably throw three picks. 

&nbsp;

Away against the Eagles: **Win**

Ending the season on a positive note, what?? Yes, this one may be a stretch. However, if the Eagles are in the number one spot, my guess is that they would rest their starters against ours. Then again, I have no clue who will win the East so your guess is as best as mine. At any rate, I am ready to 100 percent lockdown Wentz this game, maybe.

&nbsp;

**Final record: 7-9, miss the playoffs, 3rd in NFC East**

In my book, this would be an OK first year for Rivera. Coming in with so many green players and an entirely new system can lend itself to mediocrity, but building off of this year is crucial in my book to finally escaping out of the limbo which Washington has played in since Snyder bought the team in 1999.

Draft wise, this should set us up for a pick between...12-15? A solid early/mid-first, probably drafting a receiver, tight end, or secondary player depending on who pans out this year.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Training Camp Battles to watch

&nbsp;

* Wide Receivers: 

Like previously mentioned, it is unclear who will be receivers 2 and 3 behind McLaurin. Kelvin Harmon and Steven Sims Jr. emerged as early contenders, but as noted earlier Harmon tore his ACL. Latimer was ok last year on the Giants, but can he beat out Gandy-Golden or Sims Jr. at the top of the chart. I believe players such as Trey Quinn, Cam Sims, Johnathon Johnson and Isaiah Wright are all fighting for a roster space, so seeing them as starters is extremely unlikely. **Predicted Winners: Antonio Gandy-Golden and Steven Sims Jr.**

&nbsp;

* Tight Ends: 

This whole roster spot is a toss up. I truly am hoping that Sprinkle gets a kick in the rear to elevate or somebody else steps up, as he was far from a special talent last year. His name makes sense, as he was only able to Sprinkle in a few catches from Haskins and Keenum throughout 2019. Both Richard Rogers and Logan Thomas aren't impressive, so the hope for fans is that Thad Moss or an unknown player such as Marcus Baugh is able to claim the spot. No matter who wins here, the position will be weak. **Predicted Winner: Jeremy Sprinkle**


&nbsp;

* Cornerback: 

The battle here lies between all players not named Fuller or Darby. Known Redskins names such as Fabian Moreau, Greg Stroman, Jimmy Moreland, and Danny Johnson are all fighting to be the number 3 corner or remain on the roster in a bench role. I feel at most one of these players will be cut, but overall secondary job security should remain steady for 95 percent of Washington players. **Predicted Winner: Fabian Moreau**


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Offensive and Defensive Schemes

Offense: 

One of the points I've read stressed about Scott Turner is his ability to fit the offense for the QB. As this will be his first full time OC job, it is unclear exactly what schemes he plans to run, but I assume it will be up to date with the fast and mobile trends of stat and data driven offenses today. Perhaps we shall see some similarities to his father, who utilized both Air Coryell and spread techniques in Carolina.

&nbsp;

Defense: Base 4-3, 4-3 Under

As mentioned before, Del Rio and Rivera are shifting our defense from a 3-4 of the past to a 4-3. This should help our rush game significantly, with players such as Ryan Anderson and Chase Young being able to fit in the scheme quite naturally, For more in depth coverage, be sure to read this [Hog's Haven](https://www.hogshaven.com/2020/3/29/21198654/a-glimpse-of-how-the-redskins-2020-defensive-can-look-under-jack-del-rio) post which will explain it more in depth.

A 69 yard touchdown was going to get a player 5 extra points. I began imagining the players, after getting in the endzone, grabbing 5 extra points and extending their already monster game. A 69 would put any owner in the right position for victory, the final result being a 19+ point play. 

So I wondered. Is this rule too OP? Is it absolutely absurd in every way? Will 69ing take over the league, with players getting it in from 69 left and right?

I needed to know. 

So I came to [Pro Football Reference’s](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/play_finder.cgi?request=1&match=all&year_min=2010&year_max=2019&game_type=R&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&week_num_min=0&week_num_max=99&quarter%5B%5D=1&quarter%5B%5D=2&quarter%5B%5D=3&quarter%5B%5D=4&quarter%5B%5D=5&minutes_max=15&seconds_max=0&minutes_min=0&seconds_min=0&down%5B%5D=0&down%5B%5D=1&down%5B%5D=2&down%5B%5D=3&down%5B%5D=4&yards_min=69&yards_max=69&field_pos_min_field=team&field_pos_max_field=team&end_field_pos_min_field=team&end_field_pos_max_field=team&type%5B%5D=PASS&type%5B%5D=RUSH&no_play=N&is_scoring=Y&turnover_type%5B%5D=interception&turnover_type%5B%5D=fumble&score_type%5B%5D=touchdown&rush_direction%5B%5D=LE&rush_direction%5B%5D=LT&rush_direction%5B%5D=LG&rush_direction%5B%5D=M&rush_direction%5B%5D=RG&rush_direction%5B%5D=RT&rush_direction%5B%5D=RE&pass_location%5B%5D=SL&pass_location%5B%5D=SM&pass_location%5B%5D=SR&pass_location%5B%5D=DL&pass_location%5B%5D=DM&pass_location%5B%5D=DR&order_by=yards) PLAY INDEX® (Unsure of Trademark Status). From there I began the incredibly easy search and saw this play occurred 23 times since 2010. Twice in 2019 but that’s just infrequently enough for me to be content with the rule. But then I began a frantic quest. A path to find all the 69ing that’s happened in the NFL over the last ten years, and put all the sweet, sweet video right here for you football horny bastards.

Nice.

All in all, 24 teams received/gave a 69 in the 2010s. The virgins are the Packers, Bears, Lions, Vikings, 49ers, Texans, Falcons, and Rams. The NFC North is full of virgins, the only division to not feature a regular season 69. The Jets were by far the luckiest men in town, getting a 69 five different times. Including twice in one year. Geno Smith, Drew Brees, and Kenny Stills enjoy 69ing the most. They did it two times each. Drew and Kenny hooked up two times. Technically Kenny was a wild man and was involved in the 4 man 69 with the Pats in Miami.

So there you have it folks. Your ultimate NFL 69 Compilation. Enjoy. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

>According to sources, the NFLPA has made several requests of the league, including daily COVID-19 testing, the elimination of all preseason games, financial and other compensation for players who opt out of playing for COVID-related reasons and a provision that would keep the 2021 salary cap from going down due to lost 2020 revenue.

>Source: NFLPA seeking opt-out clauses, stipends
But one source said Wednesday that a major sticking point is that the league's proposal so far would classify COVID-19 as a non-football injury. The players are pushing back on that, because when a team places a player on the non-football injury list, it is not required to pay that player.

>Hypothetically, if a player contracts the virus during a practice or a game and is placed on the NFI list as a result, his team would have the right not to pay him during his absence. Obviously, the NFLPA is fighting to avoid such a scenario.

>As of early Wednesday afternoon, there were no more formal talks scheduled between the NFL and the NFLPA, though it's expected they will speak again soon. The NFLPA was holding an internal planning call Wednesday afternoon to discuss the NFL's latest proposal, and the union also was holding a previously scheduled call with player agents later Wednesday afternoon.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

#Coaching Changes

The Bengals had minimal staff turnover from 2019. LB coach Tem Lukabu left to become the Defensive Coordinator for Boston College. He was replaced by Al Golden, who was fired after 4 seasons as the LB coach of the Detroit Lions. Considering the state of our LBs, Lukabu won’t necessarily be missed, but Golden also comes from a defense that has struggled in LB play. He will get the benefit of coaching a completely overhauled unit.

&nbsp;

The team did not renew the contract of Defensive Backs Coach Daronte Jones, who wound up taking the same position with Minnesota. He was replaced by Steve Jackson, who has coached mainly safeties in his 15 year coaching career, except for one stint as Cornerbacks Coach under Jim Schwartz in 2013 with the Detroit Lions. Jackson spent his playing career as an in-the-box safety in the 1990s, and in early interviews will seek to make the Bengals revamped secondary (see more about that below) a better tackling unit, an area they struggled with in 2019.
Troy Walters joins the team as assistant WR coach. He has been coaching in the college ranks since 2010, bouncing from wide receivers coach to offensive coordinator. He most recently held both positions at the University of Nebraska from 2017-January 2020, after which he was quickly snatched up by the Bengals. This will be his first shot in the NFL.

&nbsp;

ST Assistant Brayden Coombs left after seven seasons with the team to become the Detroit Lions Special Teams Coordinator. Coombs wore many hats during his time with the Bengals including offensive assistant and quality control for both the defense and the offense before moving to ST Assistant in 2019. He will be replaced by Colt Anderson, a young former safety who played most recently in 2017. This will be his first time coaching.

&nbsp;

Additionally, longtime Special Teams Coordinator Darrin Simmons was promoted in the offseason to Assistant Head Coach, in addition to retaining his existing role. Simmons has been with the team for 18 years, and in that tenure has consistently produced above average units. This promotion is likely a nod to his time with the team and the wealth of experience he brings to a young coach like Zac Taylor. As far as actual responsibilities that will come with this promotion, nothing has been reported from the team or beat writers.

#Free Agency

**Players lost/cut**

Player | Position | New Team | Salary
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
Andrew Billings | DT | Cleveland Browns | 1 yr, $3.5 million
Darqueze Dennard | CB | FA | N/A

Dre Kirkpatrick (released) | CB | FA | N/A
John Miller (released) | G | Carolina Panthers | 1 yr, $4 million
BW Webb (released) | CB | FA | N/A

&nbsp;

Most of the impact losses this offseason were on the defensive side. Nick Vigil might have been our best LB last year, but that isn’t saying much as the unit as a whole was among the worst in the league. Kirkpatrick and Dennard were 2 of our top 3 CBs. Kirk flashed at times, as he has throughout his career, but also continued to struggle with getting beat outside, penalties, and missed zone assignments. Dennard is a bigger loss, he was great in the slot but wants to play outside, which is the main reason he didn’t want to re-sign with us. Billings and Fejedelem were solid rotation pieces on the DL and S, respectively, but neither is a loss that can’t be replaced. Webb was flat out terrible.

&nbsp;

On the offensive side, Tyler Eifert FINALLY was healthy all season last year, but had minimal impact. Partly due to our lack of use of the TE position, but also one could watch him play and see the multitude of injuries he’s had over the years have sapped him of the athleticism that made him such an effective TE in 2015. He will be missed as a fan favorite, but there was no justifying keeping him as the price he signed for with JAX.

&nbsp;

Now we come to the offensive line where Cordy Glenn and John Miller are gone from last year. Now I’m sure everyone is familiar at this point with the struggles of Cincy’s OL. Miller started the majority of the season at RG, beating out the clear bust of Billy Price, but was never more than solid. He’s a fine backup OG. 

&nbsp;

Heading into 2019, Glenn was projected to kick inside to LG to make way for Jonah Williams at LT. However, William was knocked out for the year in training camp, so Glenn was set to be our LT once more, where he was likely the best of a bad bunch in 2018. Then he too was knocked out by a concussion in the preseason. That’s when things got….weird. Week after week Glenn would be ruled out by a concussion, taking (seemingly) much longer than most players to return to play. Now I’m not trying to downplay the seriousness of a concussion, and most fans understood and were more concerned for him than anything. Then reports started coming out that there was strife between Glenn and the FO behind the scenes. That the team thought he was ready but Glenn insisted he wasn’t. This culminated in the team suspending him in week 7 for “disciplinary reasons” related to the treatment of his concussion. The suspension was short, and he eventually returned to the field where he performed decently well, especially compared to Andre Smith and Bobby Hart (though that is the lowest possible bar to clear). However it was clear he would not be back this season after the breakdown in the relationship with the team.

&nbsp;

The Cincinnati Bengals spent more in FA this year than, well, ever. After a quiet first couple of days, fans assumed this would be like every other year: Cincy would wait for the top tier FAs to get signed to big money deals, miss out on some middle tier FAs that would fill in some gaps, and settle for some low level guys that don’t make much impact. Boy were we wrong. First Cincy made DJ Reader one of the highest paid DTs in the league (at the time). He will help anchor the interior of the OL next to Geno Atkins and help solve our issues with stopping the run. 

&nbsp;

This was soon followed by bringing in Trae Waynes and Mackensie Alexander to bolster a secondary that was below average last season. Waynes will replace the disappointing Dre Kirkpatrick, who was later cut, as the teams #2 outside CB. Alexander will man the slot position after Darqueze Dennard opted to not re-sign with the team, indicating he wants the opportunity to move back outside. Dennard was among the league’s best in the slot, but struggled earlier in his career on the outside, so it was better for the team to move on and for Dennard to seek that opportunity elsewhere. As of this writing, both remain FAs.

&nbsp;

But the Bengals weren’t done. Soon came announcements of more signings: OG Xavier Su’a-Filo from the Cowboys to compete at RG. LB Josh Bynes from Baltimore. And finally SS Von Bell, who became available after Malcolm Jenkins returned to the Saints. All told the Bengals committed some $150 million in contracts to FAs, mainly on the defensive side of the ball. It was a massive change in policy from how the Bengals have run since the dawn of Free Agency.

&nbsp;

Among the players we re-signed, most were no more than backups or role players, with the notable exception of slapping the Franchise Tag on WR A.J. Green. Green has missed the last year and a half of football due to injuries, but reports are he’s healthy and ready to go. There wasn’t much traction on signing a new contract pre-Covid, and now it seems both sides are content to play 1 year on the tag and re-evaluate a longer contract after that.

I wrote the Defending the Draft for the Bengals [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/NFL_Draft/comments/ghohs8/defending_the_draft_2020_cincinnati_bengals/) so if you’d like a little more in depth look at our draft check that out.

&nbsp;


**Round 1, Pick 1: Joe Burrow, QB, LSU**

No brainer. This pick was pretty much a lock since at least the CFB National Championship Game, though that didn’t stop analysts from throwing out a variety of scenarios in which Burrow didn’t end up a Bengal. Burrow is coming off the greatest season by a QB in CFB history, and fans are excited. There’s no such thing as a sure thing when it comes to drafting players, but Burrow shows on tape the accuracy, pocket awareness, and ability to make plays when things break down to be an elite QB in the NFL.

&nbsp;

**Round 2, Pick 33: Tee Higgins, WR, Clemson**

The team had lots of options at 33. Most expected OT or LB, the team’s two weakest positions, to be addressed here. WR was also in play, but the name Tee Higgins rarely came up. In fact, Higgins was a little bit lost all offseason amongst the volume of talented WR available this year.


Higgins is a Bengals fan who models his game after AJ Green. He should start the season lining up outside across from Green, with Boyd manning the slot.

&nbsp;

**Round 3, Pick 65: Logan Wilson, MLB, Wyoming**

The Bengals have taken lots of stabs in the middle rounds at fixing their LB problems, and thus far none have panned out. Wilson seems to be a much more complete backer than previous attempts however. A 4 year starter at MLB, he was an effective run stopper with over 400 career tackles, who also showed athleticism and good instincts against the pass. He has the potential to be the captain of the defense this team has been looking for.

&nbsp;

**Round 4, Pick 107: Akeem Davis-Gaither, OLB, Appalachian State**

Many were surprised to see the team double dip at LB rather than addressing other holes. But if you watched the LB play last year, you wouldn’t second guess the decision. The team has struggled for YEARS at covering TEs and RBs. Enter Davis-Gaither. Among the best coverage LBs in this year’s draft, the hope is ADG can slot in as a nickel LB to help ease these woes.

&nbsp;

**Round 5, Pick 147: Khalid Kareem, DE, Notre Dame**

 He has the power to set the edge effectively and bring down big ball carriers. He likely does not have the athletic ability nor the pass rush repertoire to transition to a 4-3 starter, but should fit nicely into the rotation the Bengals deploy and help solve some of their woes against the rush.

&nbsp;

**Round 6, Pick 180: Hakeem Adeniji, OT, Kansas**

Finally, OL is addressed! Waiting until the 6th to draft anyone to help out on the OL really drove home what the coaching staff said all offseason, they’re happy with the guys they have and expect growth and improvement from them. Still, you can never have too much depth and Adeniji should provide that. While he played OT through college, his size and athleticism show more of an OG at the NFL level. The hope is he can be a backup all along the line and a spot starter when needed.

&nbsp;

**Round 7, Pick 215: Markus Bailey, MLB, Purdue**

A 3rd LB? That’s what happens when you try to completely reinvent a position over one offseason. Bailey has the resume of a much higher draft pick than the 7th round, but unfortunately back to back knee injuries pushed him down the board. He has all the IQ you want in a MLB, and his tape shows athleticism and instincts. If he recovers to full health he could be a draft steal, but as is should still make the team as a solid ST contributor.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Overall this was a solid draft. Burrow was an easy choice at #1, and the potential is sky high. It’s been a long time since anyone said that about a Bengals QB. The next three picks of Higgins, Wilson, and ADG are strong candidates to start as rookies. The main criticism of this draft is not addressing OL, especially when the team had multiple chances to do so in the mid rounds. However that is not enough to grade this draft badly, and I’d give it an A- as things stand.

**Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses**

&nbsp;

**QB:** 

The Bengals had subpar play from QBs in 2019. Andy Dalton regressed to well below average, while Ryan Finley was downright putrid. Part of these struggles can be blamed on our turnstile OL, but beyond that it was clear the Bengals needed. a new answer at QB.
Joe Burrow was drafted to start day 1, and the team will ride or die with him. His ability to move in and out of the pocket will be a huge asset if the line doesn’t improve from last year. He will also have a talented WR corps and stable of RBs to work with. However, he is still a rookie and there will be growing pains. No matter how dominant he looked in college one cannot expect him to step into the NFL, especially with a truncated offseason, and play to that level. The best one should be rooting for is that he continues to grow throughout the year and shows flashes of that elite play that rocketed him to the #1 pick. Something akin to Baker Mayfield or Andrew Luck’s rookie season should be the high end of expectations.

&nbsp;

**Backfield:** 

Joe Mixon leads the way with solid depth, especially if Rodney Anderson can stay healthy. Mixon is a top 10 dual threat RB, who will hopefully be used more in the passing game this year, an area he was underutilized in 2019. Part of this is because backup Gio Bernard is a top pass catcher, as well as a solid pass protector. When asked to shoulder the load, he has had many great games over the years. Trayveon Williams never even saw the field last year, but showed some talent in preseason. And the aforementioned Anderson has all the talent in the world, but injury after injury in college and then his rookie year have derailed his career. Still, there is hope he can at least carve out a contributing role. If Mixon goes down the team would most likely platoon Bernard and Williams, which would be a considerable downgrade given Mixon’s talent.

&nbsp;

**OL:**

Right now this is the team’s biggest question mark. The unit ranked among the worst last season, if not the outright worst in the league. The team opted to not spend any high draft capital on the position group, though they did grab Hakeem Adeniji in the 6th. The only returning starter with confidence is C Trey Hopkins, and even he only ranked about average compared to his peers. Several sub-par starters from 2019 are currently projected to start again, including Bobby Hart and Michael Jordan. 
There are some reasons to be optimistic however. Jonah Williams will be back to anchor the LT spot after missing all of last season. If he can be the player he was drafted to be, that will instantly upgrade the unit. Further, the coaching staff has talked a lot about players they expect to take a leap, chiefly OG Michael Jordan and possible new RT Fred Johnson. If those players can lock down their spots and take the next step, this unit could end up middle of the pack in the league.

&nbsp;

**Pass catchers:** 

On paper this is a great unit. Green has played like a top 5 WR for most of his career. Boyd is reliable in the slot, among the best in the league. Higgins projects as a Baby Green, who gets to learn from the player he modeled his game after. And Ross can run past anybody in the league. But there’s still a lot of question marks that knock this unit down a few spots in the rankings. Green hasn’t played in 1.5 years due to injury. Can he return to his old form at 32? Higgins has concerns about separation that caused him to fall to the 2nd round, will he be able to win outside against NFL corners? 

And Ross. Oh John Ross. The #9 pick from 2017 hasn’t remotely lived up to his drafting, struggling with injuries, drops, and quitting on routes. He will flash here and there, including getting off to a hot start last year, but is yet to put it all together. Going into the final year of his contract, he will most likely be the #4 WR on the team. Will that help him to better showcase his talent? Here’s hoping. But speaking as someone who hated the pick at the time, I’m not holding my breath.

At TE the unit features 2nd year Drew Sample and C.J Uzomah. Neither was particularly utilized nor effective last year. There's still a chance for Sample to become a contributor, after all he was drafted in the 2nd round and did miss time with injury last year. However thus far the Zac Taylor offense mainly utilizes TEs as blockers, and there is no reason to assume that shifts dramatically this year.

&nbsp;

**DL:** 

This is without a doubt the best unit on the team. The unit has a great pass rush anchored by Geno Atkins, who will benefit immensely from newcomer DJ Reader joining him in the middle and eating up. Reader is known more as a run stuffer than a pass rusher, but is not slouch when it comes to collapsing the pocket. 
At DE there’s a solid rotation of perennially underrated Carlos Dunlap, Sam Hubbard, and Carl Lawson. Hubbard improved immensely in his sophomore season, and Lawson played well coming off an ACL tear. If he can play like he did his rookie season now that he’s fully healthy, this unit could be top 10 in pass rushing. 

Defending against the run was a weakness of this unit last season, but the addition of Reader in the middle and rookie Khalid Kareem in the rotation outside will help with that. Reader is a monster of a man at 6’3” and 347 lbs. Having him anchor the line should go a long way to preventing teams from gashing us down the middle again and again like last season. Rookie Khalid Kareem will work into our DE rotation and has great tape when it comes to setting the edge and defending against the run. While he may not offer much at this level when it comes to pass rush, he should still help elevate the unit.

&nbsp;

**LB:** 

Last year’s bottom of the barrel unit was almost completely revamped in the offseason. Returning 2nd year player Germaine Pratt will be joined by draft picks Logan Wilson, Akeem Davis-Gaither, and Markus Bailey, as well as FA signing Josh Bynes. The unit can’t be any worse than last year, and the newcomers offer a lot of reasons for hope. Wilson and ADG both showed great athleticism and coverage ability in college. Both should see extensive playing time as rookies, with Wilson aiming to be a 3 down LB while ADG should see plenty of play in nickel and dime packages.  

Bynes was an above average player on the Ravens defense last year who now will have to step up to be the veteran in the room. While most are ecstatic about these new faces, it has to be said that a new LB coach with all new players, most of whom are rookies, will see some growing pains. 

&nbsp;

**Secondary:** 

Next to the LB corps, this was the most overhauled unit on the team. Trae Waynes and Mackensie Alexander replace Dre Kirkpatrick and Darqueze Dennard, and Von Bell should move into the starting SS role over Shawn Williams. This unit had a fair amount of struggles last year, along with the rest of the defense. One area they should show significant improvement this year is in run support. New secondary coach Steve Jackson emphasizes tackling and physicality, and Waynes and Bell are both known for being sure tacklers. 

In terms of pass protection Waynes is a slight upgrade to Kirkpatrick, especially if he can play more like he did 2 seasons ago. Alexander is a slight downgrade to Dennard’s coverage ability in the slot, but not enough to be a liability. Finally Bell is a definite upgrade to Williams, who has always struggled in coverage and is much more comfortable in the box as a S/LB hybrid.

For depth, CB Darius Phillips flashed last year so should see more snaps in dime packages, and FA acquisition Leshaun Sims will be an instant upgrade from BW Webb if nothing else.

&nbsp;

**Special Teams:**

The Bengals have generally had above average to good units under Darrin Simmons. In fact, Football Outsiders ranked them the #1 unit in the league for 2019. Kicker Randy Bullock is closer to average, but is still fairly consistent at the position, if underwhelming at times. Kevin Huber has long been a quality punter, good at pinning teams inside the 20. 

Alex Erickson has been the main punt/kick returner the last few years, however last year he ceded many kick returns to CB Darius Phillips. Going into this year it is assumed they will continue to split the load, though Erickson may not stick on the roster if the team goes a different way at returner as that has been his primary role in a crowded WR room. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Training Camp Battles to watch**

**Backup QB:**

Ryan Finley was atrocious last year. In 3 starts he managed 474 yds on 47.4% completion, with only 2 TDs. Some fans want Jake Dolegala, who has stuck on the roster after some solid preseason performances, to take over as the primary backup. But considering the staff didn’t even give him a look despite Finley playing so terribly, it’s unlikely he unseats Finley for the #2 role. Perhaps the Bengals carry 3, but it seems more likely one of them ends up on the practice squad. 

**Projected Winner: Ryan Finley**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**RT:** **Fred Johnson vs Bobby Hart**

Ahh Bobby Hart. Long known as one of the worst starting OTs in the league, he’s becoming more and more famous for his asinine Instagram posts. Hart played both RT and LT last season, as injuries to Jonah Williams, Cordy Glenn, and Andre Smith forced him to the left side of the line for a time. Fred Johnson was signed off the Steelers’ practice squad and ended up making 2 starts at LT towards the end of the season, performing admirably and showing possibly the best tape of any Bengals’ OT last season.

Heading into this season, with the healthy Jonah Williams expected to lock down LT, these two are poised to battle it out for RT. Hart has the edge in experience and has been repeatedly defended by the coaching staff despite fans’ frustration with his play. But don’t count out Johnson either. A complete surprise last season, he has earned rave reviews from OL coach Jim Turner. This one could go either way.

**Projected Winner: Fred Johnson**

**Prediction: 7-9**

&nbsp;

Assuming there is a 2020 season, the Bengals have nowhere to go but up after finishing 2-14 (unless they decide to become the 2017 Browns). And in looking at the schedule, combined with an on paper much improved roster, there’s much potential. Finishing last in the division gets us matchups against JAX, MIA, and LAC, who all project to be much easier matchups than their respective division rivals. 

&nbsp;

The Bengals also get to play the NFC East this year, which last season was one of the worst divisions in football. However, the Bengals also have to face the Ravens and Steelers twice, and despite the Browns underwhelming last year, they are stacked on both sides of the ball. If the new coaching staff can get more of Rookie Baker Mayfield rather than Year 2 Baker, they will be a dangerous team to contend with.

&nbsp;

I think it’s reasonable to expect the Bengals to finish somewhere with 6-8 wins. They should show clear improvement from last year’s squad due to the offseason acquisitions, but will still be dealing with a rookie QB (who likely will get a limited to no offseason) and still play in one of the toughest divisions in football. Playoffs are a stretch to project this year, but Zac Taylor will be on the hot seat if he shows no improvement over last year with the new additions he’s been given.  Most likely the team will be drafting in the 10-15 range.

We have talked a lot about breakout NFL players, most improved  position groups and all that kind of stuff. Now I want to shift the  focus more towards players, who aren’t in a position where they are  locked in as long-time contributors for their respective teams and will  be entering a crucial season in their careers.

Those can be young players not living up to their draft status, guys  in a contract year wanting to earn another lucrative deal or long-time  veterans trying to stick around. I called this a make-or-break season  for these players because they aren’t at a point, where people recognize  them as some of the best players at their position. So you won’t see  necessarily see players on the franchise tag, trying to earn that  long-term contract for big money, but rather guys who could also be  labelled as draft busts or washed up veterans.

Here is the list:

&#x200B;

## Mitch Trubisky

I think this really is the most obvious pick here. The 49ers tricked  the Bears to give up two third-round picks and a fourth-rounder to move  up that one spot at number two overall back in the 2017 draft, where  they made Mitch Trubisky the first quarterback selected. Patrick Mahomes  and Deshaun Watson were famously picked later on in the first round and  he will forever be linked to those guys. However, unlike those two  stars, who to me are both already top five QBs in the league, Trubisky  recently had his fifth-year option declined and is now in competition  with Nick Foles for the starting job, who might know the Matt Nagy  offense better than any of the other quarterbacks that have been there  in Chicago recently, from their time in Kansas City together. So this  might be over before the season even starts for Chicago, since Foles  might grab that starting gig and never look back. However, even if he  doesn’t, Mitch will see him every single time he looks over his  shoulder. At the same time, if Trubisky doesn’t win the competition, with Foles’ injury history and the fact he hasn’t started double-digit  games since 2015, there is still a chance to win Bears fans back if he  comes in late and takes this team to the playoffs, more in the role of  what Foles has done a few times in his career. Mitch’s accuracy and  decision-making are still way up and down, but he has plenty of arm  talent and is one of the better runners in the league off scrambles. I  think the pieces are pretty much all there now to support him on  offense. David Montgomery I expect to become close to a workhorse back  in his second season – you can read up on [my analysis on him](https://halilsrealfootballtalk.com/2020/06/03/breakout-candidates-for-2020-offense-edition/)  – Allen Robinson is one of the best receivers nobody ever talks about,  Anthony Miller should take another step as I guy you can get the ball to  quickly and let him go to work and with like a hundred tight-ends on  the roster – most notably second-round pick Cole Kmet (Notre Dame) as a  solid all-around prospect and Jimmy Graham, who should at least be a  weapon in the red-zone – that group should finally produce as well. With  Nagy trying to manipulate the defense with certain personnel sets and  moving those pieces around, that can be a big plus. If Chicago’s defense  can return to their 2018 form, when they led the league in takeaways  and had Khalil Mack wrecking opposing gameplans, and Trubisky gets a  chance to just do his thing, which is taking advantage of easy  opportunities and converting on some drives – his career could still go a  completely different way.

&#x200B;

## Jarrad Davis

Linebacker is always a tough position to projection to the NFL,  simply because in some conferences the run fits can be all over the map  and their respective coaches rarely give them any difficult tasks in  coverage, mostly just controlling the shallow zones. However, this guy  gave a lot of people Ray Lewis vibes coming out of Florida, with his  ability to run sideline-to-sideline and the thump he brought as a  hitter. After a promising rookie campaign, Davis has simply been banged  up and just not playing well. He recently saw his fifth-year option  declined and this Detroit front office has invested a lot into the  linebacker position, with a second-round pick being spent on Jahlani  Tavai out of Hawaii last year, then signing Jamie Collins to a big deal  in free agency this offseason and later on bringing in former Chief  Reggie Ragland as well. Devon Kennard easily led the Lions LBs in snaps  last season as their starting JACK, which is what I believe they signed  Collins for as a hybrid player. Christian Jones played every spot for  them last season after being mostly limited to WILL before that. That  penciled Davis in as the MIKE, but with the presence of Tavai, he was  moved to the weak-side or subbed out altogether at times. Jalen  Reeves-Maybin is another guy you can throw in there as a sub-package  player due to the range he presents. It’ll be very interesting to see  how all those pieces are put together, but I just know there is plenty  of bodies to take away snaps from Davis. Especially as a run-plugging  two-down MIKE, considering Davis hasn’t intercepted a pass since his  rookie season and only broke up one pass last year – Ragland can  absolutely replace that and he has played much better in that role these  last couple of seasons. Even if the Lions decide to move on from Davis  next offseason, if he can play well this year and get signed to be in a  starter role, he can stick around for a while, but this is one of those  things, where you have a disappointing high draft pick, who is a  familiar candidate on the injury report weekly, that might be forgotten  about and out of the league soon. I’ve seen it happen too many times  before to think this is out of the realm of possibility. So he needs to  prove he can be a difference-maker in the middle of a defense and stay  on the field.

&#x200B;

## Jalen Mills

Originally a seventh-round pick for the Eagles back in 2016, Mills  became a real contributor for this team and someone that fans rallied  behind. Since his rookie year, he has played at least 90 percent of the  defensive snaps when available at corner, but now he signed another  one-year, prove-it deal for four million dollars, while also being asked  to make the switch to safety. After watching the All or Nothing series  on the Eagles, the “Green Goblin” clearly brings a certain energy to  this defense and team overall and the coaches seem to be big fans of  his. He has plenty of ball production, with 34 plays on the ball  (including four picks) over the 32 games he has played in these last  three seasons and he was fairly dependable tackler for a corner, missing  just 11 of those since 2018. However, he was out for 15 games over the  last two years combined and still allowed almost 1200 yards and five  touchdowns over that stretch, whilst surrendering a passer rating North  of 100 in both of them. I never thought he was even average on the  outside at any point of his career and the numbers back me up here. With  Darius Slay being thrown into the mix with Avonte Maddox, Sidney Jones  and Rasul Douglas to go along with Nickell Robey-Coleman and  fourth-round pick K’Von Wallace (Clemson) to compete for snaps in the  slot, there just wasn’t any room for Mills, but Philadelphia all of a  sudden had a hole at strong safety once Malcolm Jenkins decided to leave  in free agency. I certainly don’t believe he can replace all of the  things Jenkins did for this team in recent years, covering deep,  dropping down into the slot, playing some dime linebacker and basically  doing everything other than bring home milk, but I think he can fill  some role. Pairing him up with Rodney McLeod and allowing him to roam  around more underneath, dropping down into the flats or acting as a  robber with as much man-coverage Jim Schwartz will now run that he has  an actual number one corner, could enhance his strengths as a physical  player, who doesn’t mind sticking his face in the fan and taking  ball-carriers to the ground, rather than seeing him get toasted Amari  Cooper and others. With that being said, Mills has some competition on  the roster, after the Eagles signed a starter-level player in Will Parks  and drafted Wallace, who could succeed in that role as well if you  don’t give him too much deep coverage responsibilities. So Mills could  earn another contract if he successfully makes the transition, but he  could also easily be expendable next offseason.

&#x200B;

## Teddy Bridgewater

Let me start like this – Teddy B is a guy you just have to root for,  after working his way back up from a horrific injury with the Vikings  and now finally earning a starting job again for the first time since  2015. He filled in admirably for Drew Brees in New Orleans last season,  going 5-0 as a starter and earning a 63-million dollar deal over three  years with the division-rival Panthers. However, when you look at that  contract, Carolina could easily get out of it after the ’21 season,  making him a prime candidate to help them groom a rookie quarterback  that season, if they end up picking early in next year’s draft. I  actually think Teddy is a great fit for that Joe Brady offense, that  doesn’t need that big-armed gunslinger, but rather a guy who can deliver  the ball accurately as they spread defenses out and attack certain  matchups. With a trio of playmakers at the receiver position in D.J.  Moore, Curtis Samuel and recently signed Robby Anderson to go with the  ultimate receiving weapon at the running back position in Christian  McCaffrey, who will be used as a coverage indicator off motions and be  heavily involved as a route-runner, the skill-position group features  everything they would need to succeed. With that being said, it sickens  me a little when people think it’s all about the quarterback and talk  about how great Teddy was – and like I said, he did well to steer the  ship – rather than acknowledging how easy Sean Payton makes things for  his quarterbacks by creating favorable matchups and killing defenses by  how he sets up screen plays, to go with how much the Saints dominated up  front on both sides of the ball. Bridgewater completing 68 percent of  his passes for almost 1400 yards, nine TDs and two picks looks great,  but he also easily finished dead-last in yards to the sticks, throwing  the ball 3.3 yards short of the marker on average, and also averaging  the lowest number of intended air yards. Being in a very similar offense  under Joe Brady will definitely help, but he will go from an elite  O-line to one that might be bottom five and I need to see how they’ll  utilize those vertical targets with Anderson primarily being a deep  threat. I think the numbers won’t look bad at the end of the season and  new head coach Matt Rhule went all-in on strengthening his defense in  the draft, but if they end up picking in the top five, I think Teddy  could be a place-warmer the following season.

&#x200B;

## Haason Reddick

A former 13th overall pick, Reddick created a major hype  train leading up to the 2017 draft and I was one of many to jump on it.  After primarily being an edge rusher at Temple, wearing one of those  highly touted single-digit numbers and increasing his production every  single season, highlighted by a mind-boggling 22.5 tackles for loss his  senior year, Reddick went down to the Senior Bowl in Mobile known as an  undersized edge player. Throughout the week, he wowed scouts and coaches  with his ability to play off the ball and how well he fared in coverage  as a former safety coming out of high school, as well as still winning  as a pass rusher. With a combine to match that versatile athletic  skill-set he showcased and being regarded as a guy who can be an  off-ball backer on base downs and then line up on the edge on third  downs, he shot all the way up to the middle of the first round, after  being projected to go somewhere in the middle of the draft originally.  Through his first three years, he has played in every single game at  multiple positions and had a few flashes, but overall he has been a big  disappointment so far. After failing to stick at inside backer, Reddick  has been demoted to solely an edge rusher in nickel packages and now  with eight overall pick Isaiah Simmons coming in as a more freakish and  versatile player to pair up with Jordan Hicks, who didn’t miss a single  snap last season and played at a near-Pro Bowl level for them, that may  not change any time soon. While Reddick obviously didn’t see his  fifth-year option picked up and will decide a lot of his future with his  play in 2020, the silver lining might be this – the Cardinals have now  added a ton of space eaters in the middle of the defense in these last  two drafts. While they will be in base quite a bit because of the heavy  amount of 12 and/or 21 personnel the teams in their division will run,  having those guys clogging up lanes on the inside could allow Reddick to  attack upfield more aggressive with Simmons quickly flowing laterally  behind him, plus since I expect the run defense on early downs to take a  big step and the team not trailing as much in general, it will lead to  more obvious passing situations. The only edge defender Arizona brought  in is Devon Kennard, who will be used more at SAM anyway, which Reddick  lacks the frame for. If Vance Joseph uses Simmons’ versatility and  deploys him as a big nickel on sub-packages and allows Reddick to an  off-ball blitzer on sub sets at times, plus he can rush from a wide  alignment more, he could have a much more productive 2020 season.

## Josh Norman

Once a standout at Coastal Carolina and diamond in the rough as a  fifth-round pick for the Carolina Panthers, Norman’s rise and fall has  been kind of unique. In his first year in the league he ended up  starting 12 games before missing all of his second season with injury,  In 2014 he made a lot of plays on the ball, but he took his game to  another level in the final year of his rookie, when he defensed 22  passes and was involved in nine total takeaways, including scoring two  touchdowns. The following offseason something very uncommon happened, as  the Panthers decided to rescind the franchise tag they had put on him  and he soon signed a five-year, 75-million contract with Washington (the  highest of any corner at that point). In his first year in the nation’s  capital he repeated those 22 plays on the ball, even if the turnovers  went down a little, but since then he has been in steep decline. So much  so that the Redskins decided to bench him late last season and then  released him a few weeks later, which led to the Bills giving him that  one-year, six-million dollar deal to re-establish himself in the league.  So the challenges as a declining player with some athletic limitations  at this point of his career are obvious, but he is “only” entering his  ninth season as a pro and has some things going for himself. First and  foremost, Norman will be back in that Panthers-style zone-heavy  defensive scheme under Sean McDermott, who was the corner’s defensive  coordinator through his entire time in Carolina, and Buffalo has two  rangy linebackers, one of the most well-rounded safety tandem’s in the  league and an improving pass rush, to not allow opposing quarterbacks to  hold onto the ball. Maybe even more important, when the Bills do need  to match up in man-coverage, they have Tre’Davious White to put on the  opposing’s best receiver and maybe a new starting nickel in  seventh-round pick Dane Jackson from Pitt. So the 32-year old won’t be  asked to really travel with anybody, his experience in zone coverage  will help him out and he will see favorable matchups when asked to play  man. With that being said, he will have to step up his game to earn  and/or keep that starting gig as the CB2, because Levi Wallace played 75  percent of the snaps for them last season, when last seen in Buffalo,  E.J. Gaines was a starter for them in 2017 and even the late-round draft  selection I just mentioned has plenty of experience on the outside in  college.

## James Conner

His rookie year, James Conner barely saw the field behind Le’Veon  Bell, but when the star back decided to hold out over contract disputes  in 2018, the second-year player took advantage of his opportunity,  amassing almost 1500 yards and 13 touchdowns from scrimmage despite  missing three games. Last season, with Bell moving on to the Jets,  Conner was in line for another big season, but the offense was stale  without Big Ben under center and the running back was banged up all  year, missing another six games. Now he is entering the final year of  his rookie deal after being a third-round pick out of nearby Pitt in  2017. First and foremost, Conner needs to stay healthy if he wants to  earn a lucrative second contract with Pittsburgh, who are known for  building up homegrown player. The offense should be much more wide open  this upcoming season, with Ben Roethlisberger coming back to give them a  legitimate passing game, to go along with Juju Smith-Schuster being  back health. Diontae Johnson is one of [my breakout candidates for 2020](https://halilsrealfootballtalk.com/2020/06/03/breakout-candidates-for-2020-offense-edition/),  James Washington showed signs last year and Eric Ebron was brought in  as more of a big flex receiver. As far as the Steelers O-line goes, they  did lose Ramon Foster to retirement, but they retain the four other  starters and have a seasoned veteran in Steven Wisniewski jumping in at  that left guard spot. So I believe Conner should have more room inside  or catching the ball underneath, but there are two challenges for him to  stay in Pittsburgh. First, they drafted another banger in a similar  mold in Benny Snell out of Kentucky in the fourth round last year and  then in the same round this April they brought in Maryland’s Anthony  McFarland, who is more of a homerun threat at the position. Plus, while  he is more of a change-of-pace, third-down back, Jaylen Samuels played  very well last season too. So there is a lot of competition for touches  already and then you look at the Steelers’ cap situation next offseason.  Cam Heyward, Bud Dupree, their two starting offensive tackles and Juju  will all become free agents and even if Ben decides to retire and they  will have that money to spend, they likely won’t be in a position to  draft a quarterback high next year and certainly don’t have a long-term  answer at the position on the roster already. If Pittsburgh needs to pay  a QB in free agency next offseason and have to decide between a  starting tackle or a young star receiver and what could be labelled an  injury-prone running back, I don’t see the latter one getting paid,  unless he decides to come back on a hometown discount or doesn’t have a  good enough season to demand any long-term money. There are too many  guys at that position already, who can combine to fill that role going  forward for peanuts.

## Ahkello Witherspoon

I actually had Witherspoon listed as one of my sleepers ahead of the  2017 NFL draft because of the length and athleticism he presented coming  out of Colorado alongside now-Cowboy Chidobe Awuzie, but the 49ers  decided to spend a third-round pick on him and he showed a lot of  promise as a rookie, starting the final eight games that year and making  nine plays on the ball, including two picks. After seeing that, I  listed him as a potential breakout candidate in year two because of how  well he fit that single-high, cover-three scheme they still run in San  Francisco. Unfortunately things have gone downhill for the  now-fourth-year corner since then. These last two years he has allowed a  combined 11 touchdowns in 22 games played, meaning he gives up one  every second game in this very easy equation, and he has intercepted  just one pass over that stretch. While I wouldn’t necessarily call it an  unwillingness anymore, he still has his issues as a tackler and when  teams know the Niners’ tendency, they take advantage of Witherspoon,  such as going to press-man in third-and-medium situations. A couple of  plays that really stick out to me came in the Divisional Round against  the Vikings, when the corner got completely off balance trying to stay  with Adam Thielen on a stutter-release to the inside and then a couple  of plays later Kirk Cousins went after him again on a deep ball to  Stefon Diggs. After that he was replaced by Emmanuel Moseley, which  happened several times in 2019, as the latter was a much more consistent  player. The athletic capability and measurables are still very  intriguing with Witherspoon, but his technique and physicality need a  lot of work. The 49ers can’t put him in off-coverage too much if they  want him to succeed and he needs to learn to stay more balanced, as he  guards receivers one-on-one or reads certain patterns. With Richard  Sherman still playing very well in that system that mostly protects him  from his deficiencies coming with age – until Sammy Watkins blows by him  in the Super Bowl – and K’Waun Williams establishing himself as a very  dependable option at nickel, there is really only spot up for  competition. Depending on how much confidence defensive coordinator  Robert Salah has in a pretty young player, he could still be in position  to defend his starting job, but Moseley is right there with him, Dontae  Johnson is looking re-stablish himself in the Bay and the X-factor in  this whole discussion is Jason Verrett, who was a rising player just a  couple of years ago, but has not been able to get back onto the field  since the 2017 season-opener with the Chargers. For Witherspoon, he will  have to prove a lot to this organization coming into the final year of  his rookie deal, but the bright spot here for him is the fact the Niners  won’t have a single corner of note under contract after this upcoming  season.

## Derek Carr

Unlike a lot of other players on this list – who actually aren’t part  of my cover photo – Carr has at least been playing on an average level  for several years now. Originally selected early in the second round of  the 2014 draft, the former Fresno State QB has started all but two  regular season games in his six-year career and despite the Raiders  going 3-13 his rookie campaign, I thought he showed a lot of great signs  and I can remember former Packer James Jones calling the young  signal-caller a “Baby Aaron Rodgers”. Carr took that next step in his  second season, when in four of the seven wins he had to bring them back  in the fourth quarter, and then in year three is when the QB really put  his stamp on the NFL. He completed 64 percent of his passes for almost  4000 yards, 28 touchdowns compared to only six interceptions and led  seven(!) game-winning drives. He had he Raiders at 12-3 in position for a  first-round bye until he broke his fibula late in week 15, which cost  them their final game and forced them to travel to Houston for a  Wildcard game with their third-string quarterback. The following season  the Silver & Black only won half as many games and Carr’s numbers  dropped pretty dramatically. In their first year under Jon Gruden, the  team went 4-12 and then last season they started out 6-4 before losing  all but one of their final six games, even though their QB completed a  career-high 70.4 percent of his passes. So considering all of that, you  could argue he hasn’t played bad and there have certainly been other  factors for the lack of success as a team, including trading away their  best player in Khalil Mack, not always surrounding the passer with a lot  of great weapons once they sent Amari Cooper to Dallas in 2018 and the  transition to a fairly young roster overall due to the draft capital  they had collected. However, I have never gotten the feeling that Gruden  is all-in on his current signal-caller and there are no excuses for him  this season with what I think is a top-five O-line, a star sophomore RB  and three new receivers brought in via the draft. Last season, Carr  averaged only 6.3 air yards per attempt and threw the ball 2.3 yards  short of the sticks (both bottom-three in the NFL), despite being in the  top half of the league in terms of times in the pocket. And that  certainly has a lot to do with the Gruden offense built on short passes  to force defenses to come upfield and then hitting throws over the top,  but I saw Carr have somebody open downfield and being hesitant to pull  the trigger or throw the ball short of the marker on third downs  routinely. The organization isn’t paying Marcus Mariota 17.6 million  over two seasons if they weren’t comfortable with actually playing him  potentially and their head coach has made it clear in years prior how  much he likes Mariota, who I actually don’t believe has improved in  terms of pocket presence or ability to come off his primary receivers  since coming into the league. I would not be shocked that if the Raiders  start out slow, they make the switch mid-season. Carr is still only 29  years old, but that 17-31 record signing his big extension just hasn’t  been good enough.

## Vic Beasley

If you followed this guy’s journey since he became a starter at  Clemson and asked anybody after his second season in the league, I don’t  think one person would have thought he would be on this list three  years later. Beasley came out of college with 30 career sacks and 48  tackles for loss and blew everybody away at the 2015 combine. That led  to the Falcons drafting him eight overall and while he didn’t just go  off as a rookie, he did start all 16 games right away. The following  season he led the league with 15.5 sacks and six forced fumbles, while  also scoring a touchdown. Unfortunately, he hasn’t resembled that type  of player these last three years with five, five and eight sacks  respectively to go with three combined fumbles forced over that stretch.  His exit from Atlanta was kind of ugly as well, when they announced on  their official Twitter account that they wouldn’t pursue negotiations  with the former top ten pick. However, he is only turning 28 this week  and should get a chance to prove the doubters wrong in Tennessee this  upcoming season. The Titans decided to sign Beasley for 9.5 million  dollars and pair him up with another young edge rusher in Harold Landry,  who doubled his sack output (nine) from that rookie year and is a  rising player. Unlike some other guys on this list, who are kind of  afterthoughts because of the stage of their career they are in or they  were added to a position group, where they still have to earn those  opportunities, to give Beasley that kind of money and not sign anybody  else at that spot, indicates he will be given all the chances to make  plays for this team. Now that Dean Pees seems to finally actually be  retired, the defensive coordinator position in Tennessee is vacant and  they don’t plan on bringing anybody in either. Mike Vrabel did add Jim  Haslett as their inside linebacker coach, who has plenty of coordinator  experience, so maybe he will call plays once September rolls around, but  according to the head coach, they are “going to do pretty much what we  have done”. That means running a hybrid defense with a 3-4 base front,  but a lot of personnel rotation, multitude of coverages and creative  pressure looks. A lot of Beasley’s struggles with consistency in Atlanta  came due to constantly switching between D-end and SAM linebacker. I  expect the Titans to run a lot of nickel, with Jeffery Simmons and one  of those space-eaters on the interior to go with Landry & Beasley on  the edges. With as much as they cover up the A-gaps with their  linebackers pre-snap, it will create a lot of one-on-ones in pass-rush  situations and then those guys get dropped out sometimes, where they  just have to cover the hook areas.

## Garett Bolles

Evaluating the rosters of all 32 NFL teams this offseason, I have  been raving about this Denver squad over and over again, whether it’s  about the weapons they have added for their second-year quarterback Drew  Lock or making key under-the-radar signings on defense. That also  includes the offensive line, where I think they will take a big step  forward with the additions of Graham Glasgow in free agency and  third-round pick Lloyd Cushenberry from LSU to strengthen the interior  and getting back last year’s big signing Ja’Wuan James at right tackle.  The one spot I’m not really sold on and neither are the Broncos  long-term is left tackle. Garett Bolles is a former top-20 pick, who saw  his fifth-year option declined despite playing a premium position and  nobody else really on that roster, who I would expect to develop into  that future starter. Coming out of Utah with just one year of experience  playing college ball, what stood out about Bolles was the nasty streak  he displayed as a run-blocker and the athleticism to put hands on people  in space or recovering against pass-rushers. Unfortunately he has not  been able to clean up his technique in protection yet, showing balance  issues, being off with some hand-placement stuff and just keeping  well-coordinated footwork. Bolles has been responsible for 15.5 sacks  over his three years in Denver and he was flagged 17(!) times last  season, which ranked second among all NFL players, and that includes 13  holding calls alone (including declined penalties). The good news is  that “only” two of them came in the final six weeks and I thought he  played a lot better once the Broncos didn’t have a statue back there in  the pocket in Drew Lock, but people within the organization have made it  clear that isn’t acceptable. For all the pieces Denver has put  together, having that reliable presence on the blindside will be a huge  factor as this team is looking to make a big jump in 2020. For Bolles in  particular, it’s not necessarily about having somebody threatening for  his starting job, with Jake Rodgers being a primary backup and only  taking over any time soon if the flags continue to fly most likely, but  about proving to the front office and coaching staff that he can man  that spot beyond this season. Having the premiere offensive line coach  in the NFL in Mike Munchak, now that Dante Scarnecchia has finally  retired, will be a big help for this young group, but if Bolles doesn’t  make some strides, no other teams will probably give him a serious  starter contract next offseason.

## Xavier Rhoades

It is kind of crazy to have this guy on the list and how he is  regarded at this point, after he was signed to a five-year, 70-million  dollar contract and was named a first-team All-Pro in 2017 only. The  cliff comes quickly for cornerbacks in general as everybody knows, but  this is an extreme case, where a player is referred as a shutdown corner  just two years ago and then now there were over a hundred guys at his  position that ranked ahead of him in Pro Football Focus’ metrics. Among  87 corners that saw at least 50 targets last season, Rhoades allowed the  highest completion percentage (around 80 according to multiple sources)  and he surrendered a passer rating North of 120. I’m not a hundred  percent sure he wasn’t hurt and we just didn’t know about it, but his  athleticism seemed to have dropped off in a crazy way and he looked like  he couldn’t run sub-five seconds in a 40-yard dash to me. The good  thing is Rhoades won’t be looked at as Indy’s CB1, since they have Rock  Ya-Sin entering his second year as a pro and I expect to take that next  step, which I recently discussed in my breakdown of the [biggest defensive breakout candidates for 2020](https://halilsrealfootballtalk.com/2020/06/09/breakout-candidates-for-2020-defense-edition/),  and the coaching staff may look at him as a veteran presence to help  the young guy out. The Colts also have a very good nickel in Kenny Moore  and a young trio of safeties that could play major snaps, but in the  end they want Rhoades to contribute on the field as well and if he wants  to stick around in the league, he needs to step his game back up. There  aren’t a bunch of talented corners on that roster otherwise, who will  be given the benefit of the doubt just to gain experience, but T.J.  Carrie is still there, who as a six-year veteran himself, and outside of  a couple of games, was at least not bad for the Browns last season. In  that zone-heavy scheme for Indy, where they give a lot of two-high  safety looks and don’t really put their corners on an island, Rhoades’  resume will probably give him the nod for week one and he might not be  exposed to where he needs to be put on the bench. From what I saw last  year, there is little to be excited about, but considering this looked  like one of the biggest drop-offs for any player I have seen in some  time, maybe we’ll see him come closer to that form from a couple of  years ago once again.

&#x200B;

## Tyrod Taylor

Similar to Derek Carr, I feel like I need to refresh people’s minds  here on the journey of Tyrod Taylor. Despite being the reigning ACC  Player of the Year, he was only a sixth-round coming out of Virginia  Tech and had to back up Joe Flacco in Baltimore for four seasons. In  2015 then-Bills head coach Rex Ryan brought Taylor and after beating out  former first-round pick E.J. Manuel and Matt Cassel, he was an  above-average starter in Buffalo for three years. In his final season  there, Sean McDermott decided to make the switch to then-rookie Nathan  Peterman, which obviously was a huge mistake, illustrated by five  first-half turnovers against the Chargers. Taylor was put back under  center and led the team to their first playoff appearance in almost 20  years, nearly beating the Jaguars in the Wildcard Round. A couple of  months later, the Bills decided to trade Taylor to Cleveland for a  third-round pick and he started the year ahead of first overall pick  Baker Mayfield originally, who would replace the veteran in the middle  of a week three Thursday Night game against the Jets and never looked  back. Last offseason he signed a two-year deal with the Chargers to back  up Philip Rivers, but now that the organization has cut ties with the  16-year veteran, he has been talked up as their starting QB for 2020.  The pieces seem to all be there – plenty of receiving weapons with  shifty slot receiver in Keenan Allen, a big-bodied jump-ball specialist  in Mike Williams, one of the more talented tight-ends in the league in  Hunter Henry if he can finally stay healthy and one of the premiere  receiving backs in the league in Austin Ekeler, who made Rivers’ numbers  look much better last season because of what he did after catching  simple checkdowns. Then they have what I believe will be an elite  defense and outside of left tackle, the best offensive line they have  had in years. However, after selecting Oregon QB Justin Herbert with the  sixth pick in the draft, Taylor will have to take advantage of this  great roster if he doesn’t want to just be a place-holder until the  rookie is ready. In my evaluations of Herbert, I came to the conclusion  that despite being pretty much a four-year starter, he still has a lot  of work to do when it comes to being an anticipatory thrower, adjusting  to what defenses do post-snap and he was kind of a deer in the  headlights in a lot of the big games for the Ducks. With that being  said, he has certainly more arm talent and is a more dangerous runner  than Tyrod, who has to show me he can keep his eyes downfield while  negotiating the rush from within the pocket and be willing to push the  ball down the field. Even if Herbert is the long-term solution for the  Bolts, Taylor could keep his job for all of 2020 and earn a starting gig  elsewhere in ’21 if he plays well.

The Rams have been a really intriguing team for me to learn about in the past few years. They are just fresh off a trip to the Super Bowl but the player who the offense was built around unfortunately had some concerning health issues all season. 

I’ve also saw that teams started to pick up on stopping the McVay offense that was spectacular in the prior years. From what I understand they still have an excellent receiving core, a talented coach, and a young QB who has excelled within the system. The only down sides or unknowns would be their running game, their o-line and possibly cap space but that would be freed up next year if I’m not mistaken.

The NFC West is going to be one of the most entertaining divisions to watch this year with immense amount of talent and success that each of the teams have seen.

 Patriots Member Services
 
 
Dear xxxxx

Thank you for your continued patience as we prepare for the 2020 football season. Today, we are reaching out with new information regarding our expected seating capacity in 2020 and how it will impact Season Ticket Members. 

Last week, Gillette Stadium met separately with members of the Massachusetts Reopening Advisory Board and Town of Foxborough officials to present a plan to safely host fans this season. Additionally, we received new requirements and recommendations from the NFL that all stadiums will follow in 2020. Those guidelines include the following stipulations:

Ticketed parties will be required to maintain at least six (6) feet of physical distance from other ticketed groups.
Ticketed parties will be arranged in blocks of ten (10) seats or less.
The first eight (8) rows of the stadium will not be accessible to fans this year.
All ticketholders will be required to wear face coverings inside the stadium.

Most importantly, in accordance with these guidelines – and subject to state and local approvals – should Gillette Stadium welcome fans in 2020 it will operate at approximately 20 percent of its total capacity. Ticket quantity and game availability will be extremely limited and it is unlikely that Season Ticket Members will have the opportunity to attend every home game in 2020. Additionally, Season Ticket Members should expect that if tickets are available, they will be given access to locations within the stadium that are different from their existing seating assignments. 

We know these constraints will impact your membership and stadium experience. However, Season Ticket Members who retain their accounts in 2020 will be given priority access to available tickets pending state and local approvals to operate with fans. We are currently working on an updated seating manifest and we will communicate forthcoming details about ticketing inventory, pricing, refunds, and the allocation process as soon as the final number of available seats is confirmed. Tickets will then be made available on a single-game basis to account for adjustments that may need to be made as the season progresses. Please also understand that the impact of our stadium capacity reductions due to physical distancing requirements will prevent us from accommodating any requests for seat upgrades or relocations this season. 

We recognize that this information may prompt you to reconsider your commitment to attending games this year. If you have decided you do not wish to retain your Membership in 2020, you are welcome to defer your Season Ticket Membership. Your existing seat location, regardless of whether you retain or defer your membership in 2020, will be protected and available for you to renew in 2021. 

If you wish to defer, please let us know prior to Friday, July 31 by completing the 2020 Deferral Agreement on your Patriots Account Manager. Once you have logged in, click your name in the upper right hand corner of the homepage. In the dropdown menu, select ""Your Account."" On the next page, complete the 2020 Deferral Agreement. Your recent payment will be applied as a credit toward the 2021 season, or we will be happy to offer you a full refund. You will receive a confirmation email within 48 hours of submitting your signed Agreement. 

 
 
DEFER MY ACCOUNT
 
 
We appreciate your continued support of our efforts to provide a safe environment for everyone at Gillette Stadium in the age of COVID-19. While the circumstances this year are unique in many ways, the one constant is your dedication to our team, and for that we are extremely grateful.

Sincerely,
Patriots Member Services

The Hartford media market is a secondary market for both away teams. My understanding is that away games are required to be shown on tv in both primary and secondary markets.

nfl,161,hr37u9,86,2020-07-14 09:08:52,9,1,"What was the worst year by a QB to start all 16 games? I was looking for what was the worst season by a QB to start all 16 games. I'm not looking for a QB that started the rest of the year because the starter went down in week 1 or 2. I'm not looking for a QB that was bad for 13 or 14 games before getting benched. I'm looking for a QB that started every game in a 16 season despite giving not giving their team any reason to continue playing them based on their performance. 

They way I accomplished this was looking at who had the worst passer rating among QBs to start every game dating back to 1978 (I did have to exclude a couple strike seasons). After having those QBs, I compared their passer rating to the league average that season. So for example if the league average passer rating was 90 and a QB had a passer rating of 90, then their % of the average would be 100%.

This actually leads to some pretty decent QBs turning out on the list. The best example was Randall Cunningham. In 1988 and 1989 he had the worst passer rating among QBs to start every game, but was actually a Pro Bowler in both seasons and was actually runner up in MVP voting in 1988. Turns out however, that not every season is like this. 

Here are the 10 worst seasons by a QB that had the worst passer rating in the league despite starting all 16 games:

Evans career in Chicago is actually pretty interesting. He was a backup QB his first few years with the Bears, then in 1980 he became the first African-American quarterback to start for the franchise, and the team went 5-5 in his 10 starts (including a perfect passer rating game against the Packers in the [biggest blowout](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198012070chi.htm) in the history of their rivalry). Following his terrible 1981 season, the head coach gets fired, and the Bears hired Mike Ditka. By the end of the '83 season, Evans was tired of being a back up, and signed a huge contract with the USFL Chicago Blitz. The USFL folds before the '86 season, and Evans went on to have a long career as a backup for the Raiders, playing his last game at the age of 40 in 1995.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

nfl,277,hqqluq,76,2020-07-13 17:44:09,17,1,"The Tragedy of Tom Brady and the Riddell VSR-4. I've had a theory for a year or two about Tom Brady. It's not that he's a system quarterback, or that all the glory belongs to Belichick. It's something much dumber than that. I've theorized that Tom Brady plays much better when wearing the Riddell VSR-4 than he does when wearing the Riddell SpeedFlex. 

I've held this belief ever since 2018 when I noticed Brady flip-flopping between the two helmets over the course of that season. One week he'd be wearing the VSR-4, the helmet he's worn all his life, and then the next the SpeedFlex would be on. It confused me, and I thought at first it was just some weird sports athlete mental thing with him where he thought he'd play better with the ol' reliable VSR-4. After the Super Bowl, I kinda lost track with the theory and didn't bother to check it. That is until tonight when the Miami Miracle was on TV, and I noticed Brady was wearing the VSR-4, and so bored out of my mind, I decided to go through every game of 2018 and track how he played wearing the VSR-4 versus how he played wearing the SpeedFlex. 

The results are as follows, in his **seven** games wearing the VSR-4, Brady threw for 1,943 yards, 13 TDs, and 4 INTs. Surely, not bad numbers. And in his **nine** games donning the SpeedFlex, Brady throws for 2,412 yards, 14 TDs, and 6 INTs. Not bad either, but I found it out that his touchdowns virtually stayed the same while his interceptions went up with the SpeedFlex.  Now, if you notice, Brady wore the SpeedFlex two more times than he did the VSR-4 that season, so I decided to compile some averages to determine what his stats would resemble if he wore the VSR-4 two more times. And since his average yardage with the VSR-4 was 277, I added that twice to the total of 1,943. Adding this gets you to 2,497, which is obviously more than 2,412, although not by much. However, using the numbers and Brady's flip-flop nature between the two helmets over the course of 2018-2019, we see that he prefers and plays better wearing the VSR-4. For further evidence that Brady prefers the VSR-4, peep which of the two helmets he wore all throughout the playoffs. It's the VSR-4 against the Chargers, the Chiefs, and of course the Rams in the Super Bowl. 

""Cool stuff, nerd. Who cares?"" Is what you're probably thinking, assuming you've read up until to this point. But, I would say this is of some relevance considering the VSR-4 has been banned by the NFL and has been deemed unsafe, meaning that Brady has worn the SpeedFlex ever since the Super Bowl. And, as we all know Tommy Terrific wasn't exactly that last season, arguably suffering his worst season in a decade or more, all while wearing the SpeedFlex. Huh. Therefore (barring another switch, which seems unlikely given that in every promo picture for the Buccaneers Brady is sporting a SpeedFlex) Tom Brady will finish his career in the SpeedFlex, a helmet he plays worse with statistically. In reflection, we should all pump the brakes on the Tompa Bay Bucs, not because of Brady's age, because he's been forced to wear a helmet he not only is seemingly uncomfortable playing with but he plays worse in. There's trouble afoot in Tampa according to numbers and the helmet.

**I will not be doing this.**

I pulled the grades for all players at all offensive & defensive positions (special teams is not included here). I also filtered out all players who did not play at least 20% of their team's snaps in the season. Some have issue with this low snap threshold, so I am including an additional 25 players as Honorable Mentions. In regards to grades, they DO include playoffs.

This ranking does not take into account positional value - it is strictly by GRADE ONLY. If two players had the same grade, the one who played more snaps was ranked higher.

Scale:

**> 90 = Elite**

**80 < 90 = Great**

**70 < 80 = Good**

**60 < 70 = Above Average**

**50 < 60 = Below Average**

**< 50 = Bad**

How you play against your division is always interesting, since those games are big rivalries and it’s important to do well in your division. These are just the raw win or loss totals and don’t take into account several factors. One of Trubisky’s wins for example was against the Vikings where he left after the first drive with a shoulder injury and the Bears still won the game. 

Some tidbits I found:

Mahomes’ only loss was to the Chargers in KC, the memorable TNF game where Mike Williams was wide open all night long. 

Watson has never lost to the Jaguars

Trubisky’s numbers have been pumped up by never losing to the Matt Patricia Lions and having some interesting wins over the Vikings. He’s only beaten GB once. 

Baker Mayfield has won more division games in two years than the Browns did in the 8 years prior. 

Both Baker and Lamar Jackson have played the Steelers less than their other two division rivals. Hue Jackson didn’t start Mayfield against PIT week 1 of 2018, and Lamar didn’t take over from Flacco until the series with PIT was completed. He would also be a healthy scratch for week 17 owing to the Ravens securing the 1 seed for the playoffs. 

Lamar’s only loss so far in the division has been against the Browns in Baltimore. 

Sam Darnold is 0-2 against NE and has never thrown a TD. He has 5 total INTs. He’s also 1-3 against Miami. Josh Allen has fared slightly better against NE with 3 total passing TD’s in 3 games and 5 INTs, but neither has played particularly well against Bill Belichick or managed to beat them.  Josh Allen has fared much better against the Dolphins, sweeping them in 2019 and winning the 2018 finale. 

Josh Rosen’s two division wins were with the Cardinals in 2018 and he swept the 49ers that year. He did not start against any AFC East teams with the Dolphins in 2019. 

Kyler Murray’s one division win in 2019 was on the road in Seattle. The Cardinals have played particularly well in Washington the last decade. 

Daniel Jones swept the Washington Redskins in 2019, but the Giants and Redskins the second match up of the year had a pretty memorable shootout between Jones and Haskins that determined each team’s standing in the division and in the draft for that year.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Both QBs play with the pocket-passing styles that appear to be aging out of the game.  At the mid-point of the 2019 season, Flacco got injured and did not see the field again.  Eventually it made more sense to give rookie QB Drew Lock snaps, all but ending Flacco's time with the team.

With a capable Jacoby Brissett and prospect Jacob Eason behind him, what is a fair over/under on games started for Rivers this year assuming he stays healthy?

#Statement on Antisemitism 

To the r/NFL community: we heard your feedback loud and clear, and while this statement is being issued later than it should be, we feel it’s important to share it regardless.

We the mods of r/NFL not only condemn the disgusting and ignorant words shared by Desean Jackson, but antisemitism and hatred towards Jewish people in all forms.

The history of global antisemitism is one that must remain at the forefront of our minds. It is for this reason that the Jewish people urge us to “never forget” the Holocaust and the climate that led to the Nazi genocide of 6,000,000 Jews.

Leading up to the Holocaust, Nazis referred to Jews as “rats,” and “untermenschen,” (German for subhuman). Nazi propaganda dehumanized the Jewish people, depicting them as child predators, corrupt bankers controlling the global money supply, and cockroaches. Antisemitism became not only tolerable, but normalized, enabling a climate that promoted ethnic cleansing and the destruction of a people.

The historic dehumanization of Jews makes Jackson’s posts on social media even more troubling. Jackson chose to share a fake quote falsely attributed to Hitler that peddled antisemitic tropes.

Antisemitism did not end with the fall of the Third Reich, and its ascent in the United States presents a troubling trend. In 2019, the Anti Defamation League reported more than 2,000 acts of assault, vandalism, and harassment against Jews— the highest level of hate crimes since 1979 (with a 56% increase in assaults). 

Desean Jackson’s words only served to fan the flames of antisemitism in a country that witnessed the horrors of Charlottesville’s “Unite the Right” rally, the Squirrel Hill synagogue massacre, and the recent kosher super market murders in New Jersey.

We pledge to continue our oath to ensure r/NFL remains a place that welcomes people of all faiths, genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and all walks of life. 

We condemn Desean Jackson, and we condemn antisemitism in all its forms.

#What Happened

1.	⁠Hate speech, including antisemitism, has been against our rules from the start. We don't support it in any way. Those who peddle antisemitism will be banned indefinitely. Period.

2.	⁠By Wednesday night, 11 threads were available to discuss this issue. By this point we had spent the day removing and banning racist and antisemitic comments and users. When Marquise Goodwin posted a disgusting support of DJax's actions, we incorrectly removed that post as we did not believe it added any context. It became clear far too late that we were on the wrong side of this decision.

3.  By this time users were brigading other posts unrelated to this situation and taking them over. A megathread was put up to stop this and have a centralized, very visible place to discuss. Other posts went up as other reactions and news came forward.

#Moving Forward

We will be having a fireside chat in August to dive deeper into community feedback and encourage you to comment below with other concerns you may have. We are also working on new internal and external policies to ensure better modding and community engagement. We don’t always get it right, but we commit to continuous improvement.

It hurts to see anti-Semitic rhetoric, especially rhetoric that’s (falsely) attributed to Hitler, being produced in the mainstream and some athletes implicitly endorsing it. We need to call it out, as this sub has been doing. 

But with this condemning of anti-Semitism I also have seen a wave of thinly veiled racism towards the Black community in the comments. Instead of calling out anti-Semitism when we see it and learning from it to promote more inclusive environments (which is the ultimate goal of exposing anti-Semitism), some comments on posts have gone way too far. To me it feels like these posts have turned into public shamings and not spreading awareness about anti-Semitism, while also sometimes leaning into racist demonization of Black people.

Please keep the comments civil and supportive. If there’s one thing being a Jew taught me about combatting anti-Semitism it’s that we need all the allies we can get, and god knows the black community needs all the allies and support it can get during these troubling times in the country too.

The thing about fighting anti-Semitism is that it’s deeply intertwined with the fight against anti-Black racism. That goes for all forms of hatred. 

We REALLY need Black-Jewish unity and solidarity during these times, so please don’t add to this divisiveness!

>But let’s take a comparative look at facts that are in all the books, the trio of interceptions, fumble recoveries and Pro Bowl selections. Through research compiled on pro-football-reference.com, Gradishar is one of 10 linebackers in NFL history with at least 20 interceptions (he had exactly 20), 10 or more fumble recoveries (he had 13) and a minimum of seven Pro Bowl appearances.

>The other nine are Ray Lewis, Joe Schmidt, Jack Lambert, Brian Urlacher, Willie Lanier, Ted Hendricks, Jack Ham, Dick Butkus, and Chuck “Concrete Charlie” Bednarik.

>Eight of those linebackers were on the NFL’s 100 anniversary team. Six of them were first-ballot Hall-of-Fame choices. The others were inducted within two years of going on the ballot for the first time. So none of them had to wait more than eight years after retirements for a gold jacket.

>Gradishar has waited over 36 years, or longer than the lifespan of all but 34 active players at the end of the 2019 regular season.

>In addition to his seven Pro Bowls, Gradishar was a six-time All-Pro, Defensive Player of the Year and the ringleader of Denver’s fabled “Orange Crush” defense, which led the Broncos to their first Super Bowl in 1977.

>Gradishar played for the Broncos from 1974, as a number-one draft choice out of Ohio State, through the 1983 season and was credited with 2,049 total tackles, including assists – with each one meticulously calculated by longtime Broncos’ defensive coordinator Joe Collier.

nfl,26,hp4g35,1,2020-07-10 23:09:39,23,1,"Bill Groman: Long Distance Twin Bill Groman: One of “The Long-Distance Twins”

The story of the Oilers’ AFL glory days could not be told without a chapter about one of their most prolific receivers. 

William “Bill” Groman was a product of tiny Heidelberg College in his hometown of Tiffin, Ohio. 

At Heidelberg in 1958, Groman led the nation in receiving touchdowns with 19 and garnered All-American honors. He was inducted into the Heidelberg College Hall of Fame in 1986.  

After going undrafted by the NFL, he taught for two years in Perrysburg, Ohio, before being persuaded to try out for the Houston Oilers in 1960. 

Groman’s impact in Houston was immediate as he flourished in the high-flying Oiler offense, racking up 1,473 yards and 12 touchdowns on 72 receptions, which earned him All-AFL honors. 

That yardage record still stands as the most receiving yards posted by a rookie in professional football, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrined his cleats from that season as a testament to his efforts.  

From his position at left end (now commonly tabbed the “X” receiver), Groman immensely benefited from an offense that ran an obscene amount of fly (aka, go) routes. 

Firing out of a three-point stance with his hand planted in the dirt like a lineman allowed Gorman to gain an explosive initial advantage over the cornerback. 

This advantage had been honed during Groman’s days as a track star.

When applying tight coverage to Groman, defending corners could not swivel their hips and turn to run backward quickly enough to keep up with his acceleration. 

Opposing defenses would try to counteract Groman’s explosiveness by loosening their coverages, which gave him plenty of space to get open with a curl route. 

Groman would plant his outside foot toward the sideline at about 10 yards, then run back toward the line of scrimmage for two or three yards.  

The corner would not have enough time to flip his hips a second time to catch up to Groman, creating an easy 8-to-10 yard gain. 

Alongside Oilers teammate Charlie Hennigan, the two were affectionately called “The Long-Distance Twins.”

In the six years he played, Groman’s teams won four AFL championships (two for the Oilers, and two for the Bills). 

Unfortunately, Groman’s brilliant AFL career was derailed by injuries. 

In the Oilers’ 1961 AFL championship game against the Los Angeles Chargers, his knee was struck by a helmet, and he would never fully recover from the torn ligaments he sustained.

However, Groman’s impact on pro football would be profound, as he accounted for 3,481 yards, 174 receptions, and 36 touchdowns during his six seasons. 

The majority of this production came during his three Houston seasons, when Groman accounted for 2,976 yards and 32 touchdowns. 

After his playing career ended, Groman had a short stint as a stockbroker before being persuaded to return to pro football as a scout for the Bengals, Buccaneers, Falcons, and Chargers, during which he tabbed such notable prospects as Doug Williams and Jamal Anderson. 

Although relatively short, Groman’s mark on the AFL and the Oiler franchise’s early success was nothing short of remarkable. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We, the members of this community, deserve to know what happened and what the stance on hate, racism, and censorship of content is going forward. I'll be blunt. The mods of this community have not stood behind our Jewish brothers and sisters during this time. In fact, it seems as if they want their struggle to be lost to time as the weekend draws near.

The very least they can do is provide an explanation of what happened and say that the actions taken on Wednesday were in no way a method of silencing the Jewish community. 

Yet they haven't even done that. All they did was post a megathread claiming they believe this was an important issue and therefore THAT SPECIFIC post could stay up thanks to their benevolence.

Sure, you see someone with a mod flair and ask them if they are against anti-semitism and they'll unequivocally say all mods are against racism and hatred. 

It's hard to believe that though when they were the ones that failed the Jewish community to begin with. And to be honest it feels like they failed the Black community also.

The problem isn't just standing against hatred. It's that they have to STAND UP for the ones that are being shown hatred. Yet all they have done is be silent and silence others.

What did they do to show their support to the black community? They shut down the sub preventing any kind of meaningful conversation that can occur allowing for us, the community, to support each other.

And on Wednesday they didn't just silence controversy. They also silenced those who stood AGAINST that hatred. There were multiple NFL players who came out in support of the Jewish community, yet we didn't hear their words and feel their support until the end of the day. And by then hatred spread faster than love could've.

A mod said it's far easier to just remove entire posts and comment threads when there are controversial topics than to actually manage the thread. It's time for mods to stop doing what's easy and to start doing what's right. 

You can't just censor controversial topics. ESPECIALLY, when it comes from a representative of the NFL like a coach, player, or media person.

It's not enough to just remove hatred. We must also actively stand against it. Silence is violence isn't just a cheesy phrase. It's a reminder for us to show our love to those who need it. 

I waited for the mods to show their love toward the Jewish community. But they haven't spoken. I don't think they hate the Jewish community. It seems they just don't care enough to show their support for you.

If any of you out there are hurting or feel alone know that even if the mods don't outright show their support by speaking up the members of this community will always have a jersey with your name on it for you, no matter your race, religion, creed, or gender.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

nfl,11812,howmp2,1260,2020-07-10 14:33:46,14,1,"DeSean Jackson. A Player's Perspective. OK.

 Here we go.

 I have listened to the many perspectives on this current situation and have taken some time to let many of my instinctual reactions to the controversy at hand settle down. I want to come at this head on with a logical and reasonable response. So with all that being said, these are my feelings, and my views on this situation. 

DeSean Jackson, in my opinion deserves to be suspended by the NFL. He also deserves to be released by the Philadelphia Eagles. I wouldn't blame them for it if they did, however it's not my call, nor is it anyone else's outside of those who make decisions in Philadelphia. Namely the owner of the team  Jeff Lurie. What he posted in regards to the Jewish community, in some kind of ill- advised attempt at motivating black America in awakening to some notion of religious divine destiny was both irresponsible, and woefully ignorant. I believe that regardless of his intent, regardless of his inability to provide any context(as he has since stated to Shannon Sharpe that  his true message was that of black empowerment and unity.) and his total lack of awareness as to the rules of online etiquette(especially in hyper sensitive 2020) show that he was reckless in thinking that he was somehow providing an uplifting statement  that would garner praise from his audience for his ""woke"" post. I am supremely disappointed that a man who has found so much success on and off the field as a 13 year professional in the NFL could allow himself to be placed in such a situation.  We have been trained on this. In the NFL we are trained each and every year about the DANGERS of social media. We have been drilled in a sense, about online interactions.  Think twice before you hit SEND. And if you really have to think twice, you probably shouldn't post it at all. 

Lets begin with what should have been the MOST OBVIOUS red flag apparent to DeSean from the outset of this entire debacle:

*""Hitler said.""*

Right then and there is when the entire thought process of sending any kind of message whatsoever should have ceased to exist. PERIOD. FULL STOP. It does not matter where you thought you were going with this, those two words should have instantaneously disrupted any notion that I might want to hear this thing out and see if I can vibe with it. So you know what that tells me? DeSean is unaware of what exactly makes Adolf Hitler's perspective utterly repulsive to what I would assume is 99.999% of the world population at large. Either he is not aware of the overall history behind the last true battle between good and evil in this world, or he was just stupid enough to post something without actually reading it or giving much more thought than, ""Its someone else holding my people back. It's a conspiracy."" In that, I will give DeSean the benefit of the doubt in my assumption that he does not know his history.  But that would also mean that since he does not know his history, he also cannot know for sure that what he is posting is even an accurate quote that can be directly attributed to the person with which it is supposed to have originated from.  That means DeSean was being lazy.

That brings me to my next point.

 DeSean posted a quote that was never actually said by Adolf Hitler. Once again, a total lack of awareness  in that he did not check his post for accuracy before posting it. That, in my opinion is not a total deal breaker in the grand scheme of stupidity, because I think its fair to say that all of us who use social media have fallen prey to the fake quote that we read, or even post and think, ""hey, that sounds like something there."" from time to time. It would be a lot more reassuring had DJax not chosen Adolf Hitler as the quote to grasp onto, but that milk has already been spilt.

This next view will likely be unpopular among my people in the black community, and brothers in the league. Or maybe it wont, but I will say it regardless.

DeSean should be held to the same standards that we hold any other individual who would have made a similar mistake(willfully or ignorantly).  I have heard NOTHING from my brothers in the league denouncing this post. The silence is DEAFENING. Let's be real for a second. Had Julian Edelman posted a picture of a quote(fake quote or not) that offered a similar perspective in reverse, presenting a narrative for Jewish people in maintaining dominance because they were superior to black people, we would be AT HIS HEAD 24/7. We would demand that he be disciplined in the harshest way imaginable for posting something so utterly ridiculous. Hold DeSean to the same standard. HOLD HIM TO THE SAME STANDARD. Denounce what he did. DEMAND PITTANCE BE PAID, and THEN educate him and open his mind up to understand better how to try to express himself when he wants to send an uplifting message.  Malcolm Jenkins said that, "" Comments were made...and they were wrong."" I say- bullshit. He almost brushed aside completely the fact that one of our brothers went off and said some downright stupid ass shit(excuse my French) that is making him look like an uninformed bigot and you have the nonchalant demeanor of someone who is only concerned about a certain agenda. Jenkins said, ""We gotta stay focused..."" I think its about as TONE DEAF as Drew Brees was in his comments. You pivot around the fact that a brother is in an obviously ugly situation, and it is actually our duty to set the record straight by calling what he did for what it is. We in the NFL community can bring him back into the fold and educate him, but WE OWE IT to guys like Julian Edelman,  Mitchell Schwartz , and other Jewish players within our NFL world to CALL IT OUT, DENOUNCE IT FULLY, and  SHOW OUR SUPPORT for educating ourselves and allowing our brothers(of all ethnic backgrounds) to help provide more knowledge within, whether it be Jewish culture or any other ethnic culture in our society. To have the nerve to go online and say this is a distraction is a slap in the face of those who have stood with us as allies in our fight to  root out racism in this 2020 age of the Black Lives Matter movement. Anything less in my opinion is hypocrisy. I was taken aback by Malcolm's belittling response to this situation. I don't know Malcolm, I have no issue with him personally. However he has got to do better in regard to his Instagram video. It was embarrassing to me to watch someone who stood up and took aim against his own teammate not 45 days ago for his tone deafness, now sitting in front of a camera with all of his expanding platform, refusing to bring that same resolve and frustration to the table when it involves one of our own. I can't vibe with that.

&#x200B;

Do I believe DeSean Jackson is a bigot or racist? No. I do not believe that at all. I admit I don't know him at all. What I do know is a person's history paints the best picture possible in gaining a fraction of an understanding of who they are. His history, in the public eye at least, shows nothing that would lead me to assume he has bigoted or racist views. What I do think is that DeSean was almost laughably(in the saddest way possible) ill-informed, gullible(we all can be at times) and unimaginably shortsighted  in the fact that he didn't think for one second that maybe he should research the validity of the post he was retweeting before he co-signed to a message that has already been fully set in it's own optic path, without regard for how he sees it, or intends to present it. You can't do that. When you want to send a message to the world, send it CLEARLY, and with context. Do not allow the world to provide context for you, because you then roll the dice and are vulnerable to the online mob that social media has become.  I got nothing but love for you DJax, I hope that you learn from this and you grow from it. I feel that we all should seek educating of one's self to be a better person today than we were yesterday. I know that this will be a hard situation to face individually and I definitely offer up myself to have a conversation with you because I want you to continue to thrive as a professional and as a person. Let this serve as a lesson, and let it change you in whatever way it organically will. Much love brother. Much love to everyone in the world.  Its been one hell of a year(in the apocalyptic, ""whats next, aliens?"" kind of way), lets circle the wagons, lock arms, and start walking in the same direction as a society. It won't be comfortable all the time, but lets start opening our ears and our hearts before we open our mouths. We owe it to each other.

He set several school records there, including most all purpose yards in a game with 401 and most yards per catch in a game at 34.9 (also a NCAA record), both in 1965 against North Texas State. 

He was drafted in the 4th round by the Philadelphia Eagles in 1967. He mainly only saw special teams action. He was traded to the Lions right before the 1970 season. 

On October 24, 1971, the Lions were playing the Bears in Detroit. In the 4th quarter, down 28-23, Hughes comes in as an injury replacement, and even caught a 32 yard pass from Greg Landry. Three plays later, Landry threw a pass that tight end Charlie Sanders dropped near the end zone. Hughes was a decoy on the play, and he started to run back to the huddle with 1:02 showing on the clock. He proceeded to collapse clutching his chest at around the 20 yard line. Dick Butkus, who saw him begin to convulse on the field, motioned to the sideline to get Hughes medical assistance. 

He passed away at Henry Ford Hospital at 5:34 pm. He was 28 years old. An autopsy showed he died from a coronary thrombosis, which caused a massive myocardial infarction that cut off blood flow to his heart. He was suffering from undiagnosed and advanced arteriosclerosis, where one of his coronary arteries was 75% blocked.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2015: Hurt

2016: Returns, posts 941 yards and 7 TDs

2017: Plays half a mediocre season with Carolina, traded to Buffalo, plays mediocre there

2018: Plays almost a full but very poor season in Buffalo, traded to Kansas City and gets targeted 5 times in 3 games.

2019: ???

2020: ??

patriots,5,hreoda,3,2020-07-14 19:46:06,19,1,"Plan to start the NFL season Plan to start the NFL: 

I've been thinking and I have an idea on how to start the season. I'm in no way a doctor, businessman, agent, player,etc so I may be missing some very minute details that our crucial to the NFL enterprise...so that being said...go easy on me.


Traditional Preseason and OTAs: Nonexistent. People are being complete idiots this summer so I think the NFL needs to take extra time to develop additional safety measures, stockpile more tests, listen to player concerns, possibly build some housing and facilities in the locations I suggest the nfl play this year (this comes later) etc. 

The ""NEW"" offseason: The NFL starts the new off-season in late August to mid Sept and transition to the their new bubble towns. Testing will be rampant starting in early to mid August with all coaches, personnel, and players. Teams will practice/ scrimage with their counterpart team from the division they will be playing in the regular season ( for example the afc north is set to play the nfc east this season so the cowboys may be set to scrimmage and practice with the steelers during this preseason). Testing is everyday/ every other day. What ever is more feasible. NFL players will follow similar rules that the NBA have in their bubble when they get to their ""NFL bubble locations"". Refs, coaches, trainers, team personnel all wear mask and prac social distance. Owners are all older and are at high risk so they receive the recommendation to stay away. Scrimmages are included in a Sunday ticket package, tv provider contracts with the NFL etc.. the press and reporters practice social distancing and tv crews limit staff and implement more technology in order to provide games to the public with limited human interactiom( this will be the same provision that goes into the actual NFL season)

The NFL season: The season starts in late September, no later.. Teams will stay in their four bubble locations around North America that they practiced in and performed their preseason scrimmages( this comes later). 2 divisons will be located in one location so that equates to 4 bubble locations for the nfl and roughly 600 people in each bubble location ( this will be due to an 75 person per team limit. Coaches, players and personnel included. anyone who can work remotely will outside of the bubble) The locations will be in low populated areas compared to the major metropolitan areas that normally house the nfl season/ teams. Teams will play their division first which equates to 3 games. Teams will then play their nf/afc division counterparts that they were set to play in the original nfl season plan within their bubble which equates to 4 more additional games bringing the total to 7 games. After the 7 games every team has a 2 week bye. This helps with testing and rest for players. Maybe this be the time players can visit with their family for the first 5 days of the week and have strong restrictions on what they can do during this week. Maybe the NFLPA and the owners recommend that contracts just for the 2020 season have restrictions in place and if players break these restrictions this will result in reduction of their guaranteed money they were set to inherit for 2020 season.. in an act of good faith the nfl players get an additional 5-15 percent hazard pay. After the first five day bye period players relocate to their new location and quarantine and undergo constant testing with strict covid rules in place ( all travel is private planes). All locations that were used during the first 7 weeks of the season will undergo cleaning measures. The last 7 games of the season will pit 2 afc divisions against one another and two nfc divisons against one another (aka afc east vs afc west) which is 4 games and then the last 3 games is the interdivisonal games. 14 games total. Games will be played on thursday nights, Friday nights ( doesn't compete against HS games), Saturday games ( let's be honest college football isn't happening), Sunday, and Monday night


Playoffs: start in January to give time for a optimistically hopeful vaccine..same format that is in place in terms of seeding and the additional wild card game that was to be put in place for this season pre covid. Before the playoffs begin everyone gets a week off to go to the final 2 bubble spot for all nfl games maybe places like Dallas, TX and quarantine with deep testing. Hopefully the state of Texas can get their stuff together and I think that Dallas faculties are like no other that is the only reason I say that. Alternative LA assuming their facility is built and covid is not rampant there. If both states can't handle it and there is not a vaccine the NFL goes to Canada. The Super Bowl will be played in the Fargo Dome if covid is not handled and players family and friends can enter the bubble after strict quarantine and testing. Super Bowl will be played in mid February in the original location if a vaccine is in place.

Possible locations:( I'm not going into detail on why I think each location is suitable)
1. Green Bay
2. Fargo dome in ND
3. Buffalo NY
4. Rural college stadiums ( state college in PA, North Dame, etc)
5. Hawaii if the location can control the virus outbreak and maybe isolate as an island
6. Canadian football sites
7. England

All locations for the 2 divisions to bubble in are drawn as a lottery with a primtime ESPN segment/ special preview show. Workers in the bubble locations like food services, drivers, cleaners, etc are all given 20,000 dollars to quarantine in place for 2 and a half months (Bill Simmons idea for Disney workers during the NBA bubble season). If some workers that work in these locations like hotels and food services cant don't this, start a job fair for the high unemployment that is already running rampant in the US

REVENUE FOR TEAMS: players will receive full salaries and hazard pay. Im sure the nfl will get a bailout from the fed government like all millionaires and billionaires seem to be getting. TV providers redo contracts to pay more to teams for the 2020 season and maybe reduce payouts to the NFL over the next 20 years to compensate for the more money they are paying now to ""help out"" billionaires in the 202p season. NFL Sunday ticket raises price by 20 dollars and so does NFL Redzone. People will pay it. Season ticket owners get free NFL Sunday ticket and a roku if they don't have direct TV with the Sunday ticket app. 

This is a just a loose plan and I know there are a lot of holes in my plan that I'm not thinking of and thousands of provisions that go into hosting a NFL game that I have no earthy clue that go into a game that need to be worked out but these are just some thoughts. ( also I know there maybe a lot spelling/ grammatical errors.

|Nick Coe |UDFA|RFA in 2023|

**DE Analysis:** 

Bennett was traded mid-season in 2019, so his departure isn't much of a concern for depth purposes. Winovich stands out as the most likely to earn an increased role as his production in a limited rookie role was very impressive. 5.5 sacks, 4 tackles for loss, and 10 QB hits in 291 defensive snaps makes it easy to project a very high ceiling for a player entering his age 25 season.

**DT Analysis:**   
One big departure, one big addition. Shelton and Allen more or less cancel each other out, and there's no doubt the Patriots have high hopes for Butler in his 4th season after slapping a 2nd round tender on him in the offseason. The DT rotation will be in good hands with the likes of Guy, Allen, and Butler. Cowart, Wallace, and Murray will likely compete for a potential 4th roster spot and/or practice squad membership.

**LB Analysis:**   
Net gains do not appear to outweigh net losses for the LB corps. New England has a concerning amount of snaps and production to replace with the departures of Collins and Van Noy, who ranked 1st and 2nd in sacks and forced fumbles in '19. 

In house, an aging Hightower can be relatively trusted to maintain his role, but an injury would make his snaps and production a major issue as well. With 24 missed games over the last six years, his health is anything but a guarantee. 

Bentley and Calhoun likely will be presented with additional opportunities and expanded roles. Rivers will be looking to avoid the injury bug and finally fulfill expectations as the team's top draft choice in 2017. 

Brandon Copeland strikes me as an underrated offseason signing. At the minimum, he's a quality addition to the special teams unit and with five sacks in 2018 he also sports some pass-rushing chops. 

Uche and Jennings will both have major opportunities as rookies to compete for snaps and we may see more versatility out of the edge players like Simon, Wise, and Winovich when it comes to needs at LB as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

patriots,53,hqqmlo,18,2020-07-13 17:45:25,17,1,"The Tragedy of Tom Brady and the Riddell VSR-4 I've had a theory for a year or two about Tom Brady. It's not that he's a system quarterback, or that all the glory belongs to Belichick. It's something much dumber than that. I've theorized that Tom Brady plays much better when wearing the Riddell VSR-4 than he does when wearing the Riddell SpeedFlex. 

I've held this belief ever since 2018 when I noticed Brady flip-flopping between the two helmets over the course of that season. One week he'd be wearing the VSR-4, the helmet he's worn all his life, and then the next the SpeedFlex would be on. It confused me, and I thought at first it was just some weird sports athlete mental thing with him where he thought he'd play better with the ol' reliable VSR-4. After the Super Bowl, I kinda lost track with the theory and didn't bother to check it. That is until tonight when the Miami Miracle was on TV, and I noticed Brady was wearing the VSR-4, and so bored out of my mind, I decided to go through every game of 2018 and track how he played wearing the VSR-4 versus how he played wearing the SpeedFlex. 

The results are as follows, in his **seven** games wearing the VSR-4, Brady threw for 1,943 yards, 13 TDs, and 4 INTs. Surely, not bad numbers. And in his **nine** games donning the SpeedFlex, Brady throws for 2,412 yards, 14 TDs, and 6 INTs. Not bad either, but I found it out that his touchdowns virtually stayed the same while his interceptions went up with the SpeedFlex.  Now, if you notice, Brady wore the SpeedFlex two more times than he did the VSR-4 that season, so I decided to compile some averages to determine what his stats would resemble if he wore the VSR-4 two more times. And since his average yardage with the VSR-4 was 277, I added that twice to the total of 1,943. Adding this gets you to 2,497, which is obviously more than 2,412, although not by much. However, using the numbers and Brady's flip-flop nature between the two helmets over the course of 2018-2019, we see that he prefers and plays better wearing the VSR-4. For further evidence that Brady prefers the VSR-4, peep which of the two helmets he wore all throughout the playoffs. It's the VSR-4 against the Chargers, the Chiefs, and of course the Rams in the Super Bowl. 

""Cool stuff, nerd. Who cares?"" Is what you're probably thinking, assuming you've read up until to this point. But, I would say this is of some relevance considering the VSR-4 has been banned by the NFL and has been deemed unsafe, meaning that Brady has worn the SpeedFlex ever since the Super Bowl. And, as we all know Tommy Terrific wasn't exactly that last season, arguably suffering his worst season in a decade or more, all while wearing the SpeedFlex. Huh. Therefore (barring another switch, which seems unlikely given that in every promo picture for the Buccaneers Brady is sporting a SpeedFlex) Tom Brady will finish his career in the SpeedFlex, a helmet he plays worse with statistically. In reflection, we should all pump the brakes on the Tompa Bay Bucs, not because of Brady's age, because he's been forced to wear a helmet he not only is seemingly uncomfortable playing with but he plays worse in. There's trouble afoot in Tampa according to numbers and the helmet. 

Thank you for reading all of this. Assuming you've made it this far. I've posted this on r/NFL too, but I'm guessing you guys would find this as interesting as I do.

patriots,22,hpzpik,14,2020-07-12 12:52:26,12,1,"What is the status of the Patriots for a new-ish fan? Long story short, didn't watch a lot of football growing up till high school (no team where I live, Canada). I started to watch a bit when Brady was throwing to Moss. Since then I sorta rooted for the Pats.

In the last few few years I've become super into football through fantasy but only felt like I was a casual Pats fan cause I felt bad about jumping into being a fan of the biggest current dynasty. But when the Pats were playing I always wanted them to win. I loved Welker, I loved Moss, I loved Gronk, I loved Tom, I love Jules, I love Gilmore, and as evil as I think he is I adore Bill. 

Now I'm all fucking in, first with Studham but ESPECIALLY with Cam. I joined this sub, I read articles on the Pats, I watched the draft wondering who they were gonna take, did deep dives on Uche and Dugger, and falling in love with Nike the husky. But my question is what is like a good snapshot of the team by position? I know about the QB and WR situations but what about the rest of the team?

**Introduction**

[I recently made a post in r/nfl that took a look at NFL draft picks and drafter success.](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/hdduui/oc_analysis_of_nfl_draft_decision_maker_success/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) That post was originally made partly out of inspiration of wanting to understand Belichick's draft success, and so I wanted to dive deeper. I took two approaches to try to understand the types of prospect Bill likes to draft, as well as his success. It's important to note this analysis doesn't compare with anyone else, so there's not much point of reference.

**Belichick Prospect Types**

I wanted to understand the profile of prospects Bill typically likes to draft. I decided to look through scouting reports to see which prospects had certain common traits. I made this a binary encoding, where prospects either got a 1 or a 0 for each trait category, based on the scouting reports. I chose to use [NFL.com](https://nfl.com/) reports only just for ease of access. I did this going back to 2014, the oldest year [NFL.com](https://nfl.com/) has reports available. Below is each category and a description of what they mean.

[Prospect Skill Categories](https://preview.redd.it/1inv6yrn42a51.png?width=2180&format=png&auto=webp&s=18151ce3c32c9fd011f3f1e0fda434c7314f9d55)

For the Concerns category, they receive -1 instead of 1 if they fall into that category. This was done so that I could sum the categories binary values as a measure of prospect value.

I'll note this encoding methodology is definitely not scientific. It can hard to say a prospect is ""athletic"", especially based on a scouting report; how do you categorize a prospect with smooth, clean feet but has tight hips? I did my best to parse the scouting reports and assign these categories appropriately, but there's a grain of salt to be taken here. This was particularly an issue as later-round prospect reports have more holes in their traits and it becomes harder to confidently assign the binary values.

Below are the results of the category assignments:

[Prospect Category Assignments](https://preview.redd.it/d7n1h5zp42a51.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd1543e6c1a217e7d13a1629033f4706df270475)

The first trend I noticed was it does seem the total skillset of prospects are higher with higher draft slots, despite the potentially more lax category assignment as the draft slots get later. I decided to plot this, as seen below.

[Prospect Skillset vs Pick Number](https://preview.redd.it/bbsshcju42a51.png?width=1363&format=png&auto=webp&s=5628c3fa5cb3922455d2e63e4eddf64b4445ca3f)

It's not conclusive by any means, but there is a trend here. Anyways, I think more interesting is how often Belichick drafts players within each category. I looked at the percentage of picks within each year that fall within each category, seen here:

&#x200B;

[Prospect Category Percentages](https://preview.redd.it/ztc06m5x42a51.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8165b86cffe10a1c4a841766522bf76e9d984d5)

This is probably too small a sample size to actually have meaningful trends from, but here are a few things I note:

* Increase care for drafting athletic prospect in recent years
* Bill has consistently cared about drafting size/strength prospects, with a stable trend and more prospects than any other category except possibly production
* Bill wants prospects with college production
* Bill doesn't seem to care about technique or instincts in his prospects - perhaps he thinks he can teach these things?

**Belichick Draft Success**

*Methodology*

I used a similar method as in my [original post.](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/hdduui/oc_analysis_of_nfl_draft_decision_maker_success/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) to determine draft success.

I chose to use [Pro Football Reference's Approximate Value (AV) statistic.](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index37a8.html) It attempts to approximate the total value a player has provided to their team. It is *crucial* to note this is a cumulative statistic, so a player of 2 seasons will likely have less AV than a player of 10 seasons, regardless of talent level. Thus, comparing players across draft classes significantly apart brings bias when using AV.

For determining draft pick success, I chose to divide draft by range. My idea here is that you can't knock drafters for passing on a consensus 6th round pick that turns out to be the best player in the draft, and you can't knock a team that consistently drafts later in each round for drafting less talent. So, each pick is compared to other picks within a similar draft range. I created ranges for analysis myself, based on my own interpretation of the rhetoric around draft season - ever heard ""players ranked 20 - 40 are basically the same""? I'll re-emphasize I just made the ranges below myself, with no real formal method. The ranges can be seen below, where all bounds are inclusive.

[Draft Pick Ranges](https://preview.redd.it/ouj6mawi52a51.png?width=126&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cef9d95bbb4662358c06355ac4b6394c4eac835)

I also chose to analyze draft picks by year as well, as a drafter shouldn't be knocked for taking a player in their proper range, when that draft just happens to be weaker than other years. This also helps limit the bias when using AV. However, draftees' careers are not finalized after a couple seasons, as they could suddenly break out or fail. So, while the bias surrounding recent picks is limited with year-based comparisons, it is not fully eliminated.

So, we have a comparison to picks within the same pick range across all draft years since 1995, and comparison to picks within the same range of the same draft year. I then made four categories, of Great, Good, Okay, and Bad. The explanations of what each category means is below. For example, a good pick beats out the average pick within the same year (and draft range), but overall is worse than average for the total data set of the picks within that range - you can't fault the drafter for having a weak draft presented to them.

[Pick Success Category Definitions](https://preview.redd.it/0mfaa9xe52a51.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a60bd8c531f1844f6086b3f41168402d194d674)

All Approximate Value comparisons are made to the median AV value for the defined pick range and (if applicable) year. The AV of draft picks is heavily skewed towards 0, so the median value provides a more representative average than the mean.

*Weaknesses*

* Recent draft picks may ""randomly"" explode and shrink in value, due to factors such as player breakouts in development or significant injury
* Year and pick range categories create really small comparison sets for some draft picks
* Arbitrary boundaries drawn between draft pick ranges for comparisons
* Nothing is done to account for the rookie wage scale being implemented.

*Results*

Below are the results for how many prospects fall into each category, the percent of picks in each category, and the players that make up each category. The highlighted players are those drafted within the last two years, as they are volatile and could easily switch categories.

[Belichick Draft Success](https://preview.redd.it/844gqhp452a51.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7ab0e198140982c4d6f384bdacc74d5eb6e6c9a)

* Half of Bill's picks are at least average compared to both the total pick range data as well as the same draft year's pick range.
* Only a third of Bill's picks are bad.
* Bill is typically boom or bust (where boom is scoped relative to the pick range)
* Recent picks aren't looking good, they can't necessarily be expected to have already beat the median AV for the same pick range of all years, but many have also been worse than average compared to their draft year.
* Sony Michel is a hotly contested pick, but he's currently ahead of his draft class' median AV (in same pick range), and given his youth is easily on track to beat the median for all years.
* Tom Brady was a good pick.

Here are the counts and percentages for each category, broken down by draft pick range:

[Pick Success Stats](https://preview.redd.it/w23a0w0c52a51.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=787170aaae3935a8a8fd6cdc0d83e8caa6b950e8)

* Bill has not had a top 5 pick.
* Bill is really good with first round picks.
* Bill is really good with late picks.
* Bill struggles in the middle rounds. I have read/heard some things (can't find a link) that suggests Bill likes to draft players with a high ceiling, but low floor, in the 2nd/3rd round, which would follow with these results of either great or bad.

*Analysis of Original Post*

[Here is the post link again.](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/hdduui/oc_analysis_of_nfl_draft_decision_maker_success/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

* Bill shows boom or bust drafting results.
* Bill ranks 19th for all current drafters, in terms of percentage of picks above average with respect to AV.
* Bill ranks 6th out of 13 for drafters with at least 70 draft picks (\~7 drafts).
* Bill ranks 3th out of 9 for drafters with at least 100 picks.
* A cursory analysis shows the number of terrible picks are less correlated with number of picks than the other categories. However, it is expected that with more picks your record gets closer to 50/50 in terms of beating the average pick.

**Conclusion**

This post in itself doesn't tell us if Bill is a ""good"" drafter, as there is no comparison to anyone else. My last post tells us Bill does do well, given his sample size of draft picks.

However, we can expect Bill to beat the average result of picks, both against all years and within the same year, half of the time, so we should be quite ""happy"" with his picks about half of the time. Sony Michel was likely a good pick, objectively, even if it could have been utilized even more effectively.

Bill likes big, strong prospects with good college production, and seems to be increasingly trying to get more athletes on the field.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I hope everyone is keeping safe (and sane) in these crazy times.

Just wanted to have a quick discussion and see if there's still interest in the season schedule wallpapers for the 2020 season? 

I've been doing them for like 4(?) years and it's been an absolute joy updating them every week but there's not much that can change in regards to presentation/ layout so they might feel dated and stale to some.

So, what do ya think? 

I'd happily do them for those who use em but wanted to see where y'all stand.

So [myself, my brothers and a friend](https://patspod.com) have been going back and rewatching every Patriots game of the dynasty era. We've finished with the 2001 season, and while not every game was worth revisiting, these ones definitely were:

1. ## [Week 3 vs Colts](https://patriotsdynasty.info/game/50)

    It's Tom Brady's first start as a Patriot, but this game is all about the defense. Want to watch Peyton Manning's nightmare? This is the game.
1. ## [Week 5 vs Chargers](https://patriotsdynasty.info/game/52)

    Tom Brady throws his first TD of his career, and leads the Pats to a comeback victory in overtime. 
1. ## [Week 6 at Colts](https://patriotsdynasty.info/game/53)

    It was supposed to be Manning's revenge, but David Patten had something else in store. Question: What do Patten and Walter Payton have in common? Listen to find out.
1. ## [Week 8 at Falcons](https://patriotsdynasty.info/game/55)

    This game has it all: a top-shelf defensive performance, a rookie Michael Vick sighting, and the Patriots version of the Immaculate Reception. What would you name it? 
1. ## [Week 12 at Jets](https://patriotsdynasty.info/game/59)

    Belichick and his Patriots are vying for the top spot in the AFC East in an important matchup with his former team. 
1. ## [Week 15 vs Dolphins](https://patriotsdynasty.info/game/62)

    A winner-takes-all battle for the AFC East title. 
1. ## [AFC Divisional vs Raiders](https://patriotsdynasty.info/game/64)

    You all know the game. Greg calls it the best one of the Patriots dynasty. Do you agree? Also, hear a Raiders fan's perspective of the game.
1. ## [AFC Championship vs Steelers](https://patriotsdynasty.info/game/65)

    Your Patriots were massive underdogs, but thanks to contributions in ""all 3 phases"" (read: Troy Brown) and a cameo from Drew Bledsoe we're onto the Super Bowl!

patriots,8,hmbng2,17,2020-07-06 11:10:56,11,1,"What will the Patriots Offense Look Like? (Depending on Whether a Season Happens) With the signing of Cam Newton, we Pats Fans have a rare opportunity to discuss what the Patriots Offense might even look like this year. Typically the team shows us what it might be, as the Brady led Pats have played West Coast, 2007 Era Deep Ball, No Huddle 2 TEs, The WR option West Coast style used in the mid-2010s, Eligible Offensive Lineman receivers, Power Run, and a few others. But more or less it seemed like a certain Belichick-Brady Patriots style.

I've seen pundits who think Cam is the backup and Stidham is the first-week starter, then there are others, like myself, who believe that Cam is the starter.  The question is, what will the offense philosophy be?

Does McDaniels keep the same system he used with Brady, using either Stidham or Newton, which relies on Pocket Passing, efficiency, and multi-play drives?

Do they take a good line, a strong running QB, a solid FB, and turn the Patriots into the power run version of last years' Ravens? With tons of short route RPOs for guys like Edelman to use? But does that offense go out the door should Stidham need to start?

Do they tailor an offense built to Stidham's future strengths and force Newton to learn that this season?

Or, it being a Belichick led team, is there some obscure offense used by an ""Indian School"" coach in the 1920s mixed with some other Obscure ingenious Division III style from nowhere in 1976 that they craft uniquely for us this year?

Personally, I see Cam as the focus, and I see the chance to completely refit the offense, while still utilizing the strengths of the current roster, by using a power run RPO system that mixes our successful FB led Power Run from Super Bowl LIII with the success that the Ravens have had.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I’ve absolutely hated the Patriots after they beat us in SB 38, but have always respected your team and Brady. You’d have to be a fool not to, the things I’ve seen the Patriots  do over the past 19 years were beyond amazing. It can’t be easy, knowing year after year your team has the eyes of every fan in the NFL on it, knowing they want nothing more than to see you lose. It’s extremely difficult to even reach a super bowl, much less win one, then another, and another...and on and on. Coming from not only a Panthers fan but a football fan, I have the utmost respect for the Patriots. 

Now, the news that the Patriots signing Cam has taken over the offseason news stories.  You guys are known for scooping up players deemed washed up, too old, problematic and underachieving, then completely slapping all the naysayers in the mouth after they become stars in your organization....and winning them a ring. 

You’ve done it again, scooped up a player the entire league has completely given up on and giving him a shot. I know Tom Brady likes to tell the story about that time he told Kraft drafting him was the best decision he ever made, but signing Cam is definitely another GREAT decision. If there’s something I know about Cam, it’s when he’s focused and healthy, he’s the best QB in the league. Now you have a focused, healthy, determined and ANGRY Cam Newton. He’s hell bent on proving everyone wrong and you guys gave him the opportunity to do so. 

How fitting is it that the injury that ultimately ended his season last year, happened in a preseason game against the Patriots? That foot injury set things into motion that brought him full circle, to the Patriots. That’s pretty wild. 

The things Cam did for my team will forever hold a special place in my heart, so will he. It broke my heart when the Panthers cut him loose, it’s been months and it still hurts. Then, as time ticked by, seeing Cam still unsigned was also painful. I felt so bad for him, knowing he’s so much better than what the league sees and him seemingly being forced into retiring in the near future sucked. That’s why I was happy as hell when I heard he was signed, even if it was by the Patriots. 

I’ll probably never be a patriots fan, but I’ll always be a Cam fan. So I’ll be pulling for you guys each week unless you’re against us...and I can call this now, Cam is going to blast us if he ever gets his shot during the regular season. I’ll probably end up buying (I can’t believe I’m saying this) a Patriots jersey, just bc it has “NEWTON” on the back. 

So, I just want to say thank you to your team for signing the best QB in our franchise history. Thank you for giving him the chance nobody else would. I hope he brings you all the joy and excitement he brought us for the duration of his career thus far, I wish you guys nothing but the best of luck.

EDIT

Thank you all so much for all the positivity!  I haven’t interacted with anyone on this sub before so I wasn’t sure exactly how this would be received. You all have had a lot of good things to say about Panthers nation, which is also really cool.

patriots,32,hkp5tr,22,2020-07-03 13:19:57,13,1,"Newton's case for best rushing QB of All-Time It feels like the most Bill Belichick move ever to see this type of transition occur in one offseason. The Patriots will move on from a QB who ranks 2nd All-Time in passing TDs, replacing him with a QB who ranks 1st All-Time in rushing TDS. 

I didn't consider myself a Newton expert, and I was pretty surprised he was the runaway leader in that category recently. Turns out his rushing resume makes a strong case for the best rushing quarterback in league history. 

We can certainly use different measuring sticks or definitions for ""best"". Lamar Jackson is arguably the most electric ever, Mike Vick is inarguably the most prolific, at least so far, and players like Steve Young have an argument for the most clutch. Hell, you could seriously argue Tom Brady's 3rd and short game made him the best at that specific task. Looking at the overall stats though, it's hard to make the case against Newton as the best overall.   


**Career attempts**: 934, 1st All-Time 

**Next best**: Vick, 873 carries 

Mind you, Vick played in 143 career games over the course of 13 seasons. Newton has played in 125 over nine seasons. 

Newton's carries in 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2017 all rank within the top seven All-Time seasons for QB rushing attempts. Prior to Lamar Jackson's entrance to the league, Newton's 139 attempts in 2017 were only two behind the NFL record for a season. 

&#x200B;

**Career rushing TDs**: 58, 1st All-Time 

**Next best**: Young, 43

Newton's 58 scores have him tied for 53rd place All-Time among all position players. He's tied with Todd Gurley and ahead of names like LaGarrette Blount, Chris Johnson, Tiki Barber, Larry Johnson, Matt Forte, and Arian Foster. Apples and oranges sure, but the point stands that these players have hundreds of more carries with players like CJ2K doubles Newton's career attempts. 

Newton is so far ahead of the current crop of active QBs that Aaron Rodgers and his 28 career rushing TDs is the next closest at 18th All-Time. Brees and Brady respectively rank 24th and 28th All-Time among rushing signal-callers.

&#x200B;

**Career rushing yards**: 4,806, ranks 3rd

**1st**: Vick, 6,109

**2nd**: Randall Cunningham, 4,928  


With just 122 yards on the ground in 2020, Newton will overtake Cunningham for 2nd All-Time. With even moderate overall production for the 2020 and 2021 seasons, he could be well on his way to overtaking Vick in just a few years. His 934 career attempts and 4,806 yards over the course of 125 games averages out 7.4 carries for 38.4 yards a game.   


Extrapolated to a full season we'd get the rough averages of 120 carries for 614 yards. Two seasons of that production puts him just 75 yards behind Vick's NFL record.

Since Cam (and you guys) are basically the only football/sports news right now, thought it was worth reminding everyone that we've got an ""All or Nothing"" on our team on Amazon Prime. 

Seems like most people are excited and pretty optimistic about the Cam signing. But I still keep on running into some of the same old narratives with questions about his leadership, celebrations, etc, etc. The 2018 season was absolutely brutal for the Panthers for various reasons, and the show goes into everything that Cam and the team had to deal with, including his shoulder injury. Overall, I think it shows Cam in a positive light as a capable leader. 

This first shot tells you all you need to know. And with a lot of people still in lockdown and no live sports, what else you gonna watch?

So, I don't think it's a secret that Cam has obviously taken some pretty large hits and (generally speaking) never quite seemed to get the calls from referees for some reason or another throughout his career.  Was this because of his size? His running abilities? His time in the league? His expectations?

On the other side of the coin (again, generally speaking) I believe we can agree that The Goat probably received some preferential roughing calls throughout his career, much to the chagrin and overly salty tears of most of the NFL...

Personally, from my end, it feels big to fully realize an allegiance change from a team that has been “my home team” since the day they became a franchise. But...I think it’s finally time for me to embrace the Patriots. 

I fell out of watching football for a handful of years when I was younger, Cams first year was also when my love for the game was reignited. Cam largely was the Panthers to me, even though they were my home team and I had cheered for them since their inception. Coming back, Cam represented everything I wanted to cheer for in a franchise. His is the only Jersey I own. The Panthers FO did him dirty, a guy who not only gave everything he physically could to the team, but was also a pillar of the community in Charlotte. I could partially understand, maybe (not really), the team moving on from Cam, but the way they did it is just so shitty.  

My wife and I have lived off the Cape for 5 years. We have no plans of leaving. Cam is my guy. I’ve already celebrated Patriot Super Bowls with new friends up here.

I think it’s time to officially become a full fledged Patriot fan. Last time Cam was healthy, up until the Steelers game, he was having a better statistical season than 2015.

patriots,44,hjjtg2,15,2020-07-01 15:43:27,15,1,"The Perfect Storm: Bill Belichicks final act as head coach for New England has potential to be his best one yet, giving a city hope while paving Josh McDaniels path to replacing him. Waking up to the news of Tom Brady leaving the Patriots was my worst nightmare, I swore the day it happened I’d either burst into flames or drown in a river of my own tears, yet here I sit writing this, alive and full of hope. We all knew Tom Brady leaving our beloved New England Patriots was inevitable. Whether it was Tom vs. Time or signing with another team 🤮 everything has an expiration date. The 20 years we experienced with the GOAT were some of the best times of my life, Being a witness to our very own Michael Jordan, Mohammed Ali, Wayne Gretzky was stuff out of a story book. Contenders every year, multiple dynasty’s and some of the best football games ever played in National Football League history was what we loved through. That being said after the initial shock wave that rippled through New England and the world of Tom Brady departure we knew we still had half of the anchor that has held down the Patriots for the last two decades, Bill Belichick. I will be the first to admit that I initially doubted Bills plan in recreating a roster that could live on past Brady. Days turned into weeks then months with no inkling or finding another QB to compete with Stidham or Hoyer. With rumblings of Andy Dalton or Jameis Winston Pats Nation seemed to be gearing up for a cold period, winter was coming fast with only one move that made sense for the organization: Cameron Jerrell Newton aka Superman. 

Say what you will, Cams on the field play has been spiraling the past couple seasons. Injuries (shoulder/foot) are mostly to blame and perhaps Carolinas overall team construction/teams long term goals led to Cams release. Since the day New England’s QB position opened Cam was at the top of the teams and fans radar as we are still in win now mode, a fresh start for both Cam and New England with the potential seemingly endless. We have always heard rumblings of Bill perhaps looking forward to the day where he gets full reigns back on the team, his final opportunity to show the world that while we had the GOAT of qbs we also had the GOAT of coaches. This is where Bill gets his total dues, his decades of coaching and evolving has led him to this moment, a final act for his own legacy and a final act for the imprint he leaves in New England. Hope is powerful, hope can feed a fan base and a team.  Cam is a proven winner and has the tools to be one of the best in the league. If all goes right Cam grows old in a Patriots uniform next to eventual head coach Josh McDaniels and the Patriot way lives on for at least another half decade.

For 20 years, the Pats have been teaching O-linemen to defend for a prototypical pocket passer. It will be really interesting to see how they adjust as a unit to defending Cam, especially without Scar coaching the line again. As a sidenote, same for receivers who are going to have to run more and extend plays more often with Cam at the helm. Here's to hoping it's fun to watch!

patriots,7,hj9rnj,5,2020-07-01 07:04:23,7,1,"Panthers/Fins fan coming in peace First let me quickly address why I'm both a Dolphins and Panthers fan. I've lived in NC my whole life, but I've been a football fan longer than the Panthers have existed, and my mom's family is from Miami and big Dolphins fan. Since they're AFC/NFC loving both doesn't usually conflict.

Anyways, now my point. I hate the Patriots. Like.. I really hate the Patriots. As you probably would have guess, and would have expected. But whatever. My love for Cam is greater than my hate for the Pats. He is a great player, and a great person. Selfishly I don't like how he went to the Pats because a) like I mentioned before, I'm not a fan, and b) now I have to face him twice a year with one of my teams. But even more so, I hope he proves the haters wrong. I hope he comes out and has a MVP season, and gets himself a Super Bowl ring.

Perhaps it's the fact that I know it's only a 1 year deal, and I'm not expecting much from either the Panthers or Dolphins this year, but I hope he lights it up. I am willing to sacrifice my teams' season if it means Newton gets the respect he deserves, and gets a ring so we'll never have to have that same convo that surrounds Marino.

I see the love for Cam around the sub, and I'm grateful. You guys are getting someone that is truly special. I will never be a Pats fan, but I will never not be a Cam fan (assuming he continues being the person he is).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

patriots,0,hj8icu,37,2020-07-01 05:34:28,5,1,"I don't see why people are so happy the Patriots got Cam Newton Hes not that good anymore. People always like to bring up his MVP season but that was 5 years ago now. Newton has only had 2 good seasons and a couple decent ones. 2013 and 2015 were his best seasons but aside from that he hasn't been very good. 

He has a poor attitude. I'm surprised Bill was okay with this signing you think a guy like him would never want a guy like Newton. Big ego, hot head, hes just too much sometimes. While I think the Patriots still have a chance to win the division signing newton made those chances worse. Hes Joe Flacco but with speed. And to be honest, we dont know if newton has any speed left. 

Hes over the age of 30 now. It might be safe to say hes out of his prime. Let's remember this guy has not won a game since November of 2018. That's along time ago. I could see stidham beating newton out in the preseason. I just dont think Newton is that good anymore. Even when he was good was he really that great? Hes an average passer aside from that 2015 season where he threw 35 TDs. Hes not gonna do that again. If Brady struggled with that offense last year and then Cam Newton will definitely struggle. 

I usually root for the Patriots but with Newton there that might be hard. I feel like signing Newton was a panic move by Bill. Bill knows his job might be on the line if they do bad so he had to get a qb just in case something goes wrong. I definitely think it was a panic move. I still have full respect for this organization but Cam Newton isnt gonna make this team any better.

patriots,5,hj24mh,13,2020-06-30 21:02:48,21,1,"Updated Record Predictions Post-Cam After adding Cam, I think it’s time we reevaluated the potential of this team. Let’s take a look at the schedule and project wins and losses now that the former MVP has joined the roster.

For the sake of argument, I’m going to assume that Cam will win the job over Stidham. I don’t think this is a 100% guarantee, but I can really only see Cam losing out to 2nd-Year Jarrett if he’s still hurt or aggravates an old injury. Adding to that, I’m basing my projections on having a healthy Cam Newton all season. However, I’m going to also assume that he’s going to have a season that’s relatively in line with his pre-injury self and not necessarily in line with his MVP year. I think he’s going to play well here (better than his last few years in Carolina), but projecting an MVP year feels a little unlikely to me.   I’ve got him getting somewhere between 23 and 27 TDs and 10-14 INTs with a completion % in the low 60s and a few hundred rushing yards. That feels conservative if he’s fully healthy as reports indicate. Finally, I’m assuming that the season will not be cancelled. I am not mentally ready to consider that as an option even as it feels more and more likely by the day. Anyway let’s go week by week.

***Week 1: Patriots vs. Dolphins, Sunday 9/13, 1:00PM***

I think this one is a win for sure. The Dolphins are improving, Tua is a really solid prospect, and I like coach Flores. That being said, they’re still young, they’re on the road, and this Pats team will come out of the gate with a TON to prove. 
**Record: 1-0**

***Week 2: Patriots @ Seahawks, Sunday 9/20, 8:20PM***

Pats on the road in Seattle on Sunday Night Football feels like a classic September stumble. It wouldn’t be an easy game at any time of year, but I’ve seen this too many times to be confident heading into this one. I have the Pats losing a close game here. **Record: 1-1**

***Week 3: Patriots vs. Raiders, Sunday 9/27, 1:00pm***

I think the Raiders are ok, but an average west coast team flying east for a 1pm start? I like the Pats here. I could see this game being pretty boring. **Record: 2-1**

***Week 4: Patriots @ Chiefs, Sunday 10/4, 4:25pm***

Not a fan of this matchup. Chiefs at home are tough to beat. I don’t want to talk about this one, and I anticipate being very mad that Monday. **Record: 2-2**

***Week 5: Patriots vs. Broncos, Sunday 10/11, 1:00pm***

I think Denver is going to be pretty good this year. That defense is gnarly. This is a rock fight but coaching (BB vs 1st and 2nd year starters is insane, come at us Drew Lock) and being at Gillette get us through with a W. **Record 3-2**

Week 6: BYE

***Week 7: Patriots vs. 49ers, Sunday 10/25, 4:25pm***

Lots going on in this one. 49ers D is nuts, but they did lose DeForest Buckner which will hurt them a little. Niners are coming off a date with the Rams on SNF and the Pats are coming off a bye; that’s usually a good recipe. Every year there’s one game that the Pats lose when they shouldn’t, and one where they win that they probably shouldn’t. I actually like the Pats in an possible upset here, though I’m not overly confident. Really close. **Record: 4-2**

***Week 8: Patriots @ Bills, Sunday 11/1, 1:00pm***

I think we split with the Bills this year. Brady was dominant against Buffalo, but these Bills are better on paper than any he played off the top of my head. Adding Diggs creates problems, and even though I’m not super high on Josh Allen, I think the Bills take their home matchup. Big big implications for the division race. **Record: 4-3**

***Week 9: Patriots @ Jets, Monday 11/9, 8:15pm***

The Jets aren’t good. **Record: 5-3**

***Week 10: Patriots vs. Ravens, Sunday 11/15, 8:20pm***

Monday night football against the Ravens. I like this matchup about as much as I like the Chiefs matchup. We got younger and more athletic in the front 7, but we also got more inexperienced. A backfield with Lamar, Mark Ingram, and JK Dobbins frightens me. **Record: 5-4**

***Week 11: Patriots @ Texans, Sunday 11/22, 1:00pm***

Deshaun has given Bill some problems. We’ll need to play him better to win here. I think we drop this one for three straight losses to 2019 playoff teams in the AFC. ESPN, against all odds, gets even more annoying for the next 6 days. **Record: 5-5**

***Week 12: Patriots vs. Cardinals, Sunday 11/29, 1:00pm***

After the bye, it has been an absolute gauntlet (Jets excluded). Patriots will get back on track here, but Kyler Murray and DeAndre Hopkins will make us clench for longer than we would’ve liked. **Record: 6-5**

***Week 13: Patriots @ Chargers, Sunday 12/6, 4:25pm***

Start of a back to back in LA. They went 5-11 in 2019, but the Chargers have a talented roster. I don’t think Tyrod Taylor will make them better than last year, and they might be on to Justin Herbert by now. either way, I like the Pats on the road. **Record: 7-5**

***Week 14: Patriots @ Rams, Thursday 12/10, 8:20pm***

Fourth prime time game of the year and a nice Super Bowl LIII rematch. I actually don’t think this Rams team is all that great outside of Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey, and their cap situation is almost as bad ours with 36 million in dead money (ouch). Pats win on a short week and are starting to get on a run here. **Record 8-5**

***Week 15: Patriots @ Dolphins, Sunday 12/20, 1:00pm***

I hate that we get the Dolphins in Miami this late in the year off two straight road games. I think Miami will definitely be starting Tua by this point, and coach Flo will have some tricks up his sleeve. I was hoping the Miami curse would end with Brady, but I annoyingly think we drop this one for our unforgivable and unexplainable loss of 2020-21. **Record: 8-6**

***Week 16: Patriots vs. Bills, Monday 12/28, 8:15pm***

I said I think the Pats will split with the Bills, and each team winning their home game feels right. Have to have this one to have a chance of winning the division. Also, FIVE primetime games this season for the Pats. They’ll almost certainly flex us out of one (my guess is Rams week 14). **Record: 9-6**

***Week 17: Patriots vs. Jets, Sunday 1/3, 1:00pm***

This game will likely decide the AFC East after splitting with Buffalo and Miami (ugh). Luckily, it’s the Jets, and the Jets are bad. **Final Record: 10-6**

10-6 feels like a good year with this roster to me. Best case, I could see 11-5. If Cam doesn’t quite click, the offense struggles like last year, and the defense regresses after losing a bunch of guys in the front 7, I could see 8-8. I thought this team was a 7-9 or 8-8 team with Stidham and things going well against a brutal schedule. A healthy Cam gets us to the playoffs as a division winner or as a wild card. I think we rely hard on the running game and defense, and we probably don’t make it past the divisional round. All in all, not a bad recovery year after losing the GOAT.

He is very big in the community and loves giving back to the less fortunate. He won the fan vote for Walter Payton Man Of The Year and I bet a majority of those votes came from the Charlotte community.

Yes Cam is a big flashy cocky personality but he has always been that guy. He won  2 Nat'l championships, a Heisman trophy, and a NFL MVP. With those accolades he deserves the right to be cocky and flamboyant.

The rumors of him being a personality problem in the locker room are straight false rumors. In his 9 years in Carolina Cam was never once a problem in the locker room.

People see the funny style outfits and crazy dreadlocks and they judge a book by the cover. Cam is a good guy, he just built a reputation of being a bad guy because of his celebrations and his diva like outfits off the field. The media will hate him though, he doesn't really do well with interviews. I don't think he cares for the media honestly.😂

If you actually give him a chance you will love Cam the person. He will be heavily involved in the Boston community. He leads by example, his play will do the leading not his words. Remember that...

If healthy Cam is a top 10 QB. If not healthy he probably is done as a starter in the NFL. There is no in between.

 Stidham seemed like the guy, and we're super close to the cap. The first question that I asked was who are they planning on cutting or trading to make this acquisition.

But Cam has an amazing upside, his big risk is *only* injury, and he's been posting video after video of himself on Instagram looking great. We have him on a vet minimum VERY incentive-laden deal, which is such a great deal for the Patriots.

Don't forget, Cam was arguably a top 5 QB NFL when he was healthy. He's also the same style of QB that Stidham is, which means we can actually develop Stidham in the role that he will be playing, rather than Stidham learning the playbook when Tom Brady was QB1.

Also, neither Stidham nor Cam nor anyone is guaranteed a starting role on the Patriots, ever. You have to earn that shit. Drew Bledsoe learned that a long time ago.
Now Cam and Stidham get to both compete for a starting role, and either way, this has to benefit Stidham.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Newton's signing is a low risk-high reward move that we've seen many times before in the Belichick era. However, did we gain insight into how Stidham is viewed by his teammates? Last night, upon Schefty's tweet announcing the 1-year deal to New England we saw many Patriots react to the signing with the iconic ""eyes"" emoji. Granted, Cam is a former NFL MVP and one of the best QBs in the league when he is on and comparing him to a kid who has thrown 4 NFL passes is almost silly.

patriots,76,hi4khm,83,2020-06-29 11:42:22,11,1,"Why Cam Newton will work in New England I think most people are excited to see cam come to New England. I think Cam has a lot of potential if used the correct way. The best thing to me about this signing is the fact he has something to prove more then the usual player. Cam Newton is probably in the top 2 players in the NFL rn that have the biggest question mark on them at this very moment (right next to brady). He’s 0-8 in his last 8 starts and has been an injury riddled mess the last couple years. 2015 was the peak and it seems like he has been going on a downhill slide ever since. Not winning another playoff game since and has struggled throwing the ball. 

However I want everyone to take this into account when talking about Cam Newton and his time in Carolina. 

He was the most hit qb in the league before he started getting injured. Now some of that has to do with him and how he plays, however he also did not have a great o line when it came to pass blocking. Maybe that has to do more with scheme and how Ron Rivera wanted the offense ran but people have to remember that cams offense was centered around a run heavy offense with almost no help at the receiving core. 2015 was the MVP season for cam and these were his receivers.

Jericho Cotchery, Ted Ginn, Greg Olson and Devin Funchess.

Not exactly a good staff of weapons but they relied on newton and Jonathan Stewart for a lot of their offensive production and Olson as the main centerpiece for the throwing game. This was also the case for every year pretty much in Newton’s career outside of having Steve Smith for 1-2 seasons before he left for Baltimore. I’m just trying to get the point across that the panthers lived and died by newton and his ability to run and generate holes for the running game. That was their offense and I think it took a huge toll on Newtons body and made his throwing numbers look worse than how good he really could’ve be and now that he’s here I think his game could be so much better just because of the team around him and the coaches he has now. 

The pats receiving core has its flaws but still has upside to be a middle of the pack core, way better then anything he had in Carolina. Edelman healthy again, Sanu fully healthy, a healthy progressing N’Keal Harry, Marquise Lee, Jakobi Meyers and whoever else makes the team along with the two rookie tight ends the pats drafted. Then add in the O line that was literally a top 3 o line not even 2 years ago thats getting a healthy Andrews back and that doesn’t even include the running backs mainly Sony and James white. 

I think last year was more of just a lot of bad luck with the offense. The o line was injured, Mason and cannon struggled during the year but played nicely at the end of the season. Sanu hurt his ankle, Edelman broke his everything, Harry was injured half the year. We lost both our fullbacks, had zero capable tight ends and most importantly Brady was not happy and wasn’t fully bought into his receivers or the offense. 

That all goes away for this year as it’s a whole new slate and now you bring in Cam Newton who is looking to prove everyone wrong about doubting him and not offering him a contract. Did I mention Cam is super talented? Because he has all the talent in the world. He’s a monster of an athlete with a cannon for an arm. He is not gonna be anything like Brady accuracy wise but Idt they need him to be because this offense is gonna change a lot for this next season. McDaniels always wanted a mobile qb and probably already has an idea of what he wants to do and will probably pull from some of the ideas he used while in Denver with Tebow. Except he has a former MVP running the offense now. 

Cam can still be a top 10 QB in this league and if he can stay healthy then this offense can work, probably like what the ravens did last year because I think our o line can be that good and bully teams around. It’s all gonna be about keeping cam healthy and not letting him take all those big shots in and out of the pocket. 

This year for me just got a lot more exciting, tho I wanted to see what stidham had to show I think it’s important to give him as much time as possible to learn the offense and develop his game while we get a QB like Newton to reinvigorate his career this season. Its even more important to me that Stidham does not have to face the pressure of being the next quarterback right after Brady which is something I think Cam can handle and take in stride. In the end I think Cam is a one year deal Idt this is a long term move for Bill, I still think it’s stidham but Cam was there and gives you a much higher probability of being a contender on a smaller contract so why not give it a shot and I think it will actually work.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

patriots,425,hi0h9x,127,2020-06-29 08:07:20,8,1,"An Amateurs guide to defending Cam Newton on the internet Hello Pats fans, you all have the pleasure of having Cam Newton on your team. Cam is a controversial figure who i can honestly say is the most fun athlete ive ever rooted for.

Cam was drafted to my favorite franchise the Panthers when we are at a huge lowpoint. We were paying a cut Jake Delhomme, Jonathan Stewart and Deangelo Williams like 35% of our salary cap, our only notable player was Steve Smith and our head coach was a no named guy named Ron Rivera. Still under Cam's first year he took a pretty awful team to 7-9 and set records for rookie production at QB. He was incredible from game 1 where he threw for over 400 yards and set a debut passing record that i believe still stands. 

Anyways to get to the meat of what i have to say lets start with how to defend Cam Newton on the internet. 

The first issue everyone has with Cam is his completion percentage. Stats can sometimes oversell a narrative however.  What this ultimately comes down to is Cam having some visible bad overthrows when he tries to gun it too much which leads to a  bit of a confirmation bias. However Cam has always had a good completion percentage vs expected completion percentage. In 2017, he had Kelvin Benjamin and Devin Funchess as his starting wideouts and they combined to average the fewest yards of separation in the NFL. These things obviously will affect your completion percentage. Combined that with Mike Shula and Riveras generally gun shy approach to passing and you end up with lots of third and longs where Cam is throwing passes to shitty recievers when the entire NFL knows the next play is a pass. 

In 2018 CMC broke out and Norv and they decided to make our offense short pass based. This led to Cam having a 67% completion percentage through the first 8 games, which is easily a high mark for his career. Then after the Steelers game where Cam got his shoulder reaggrevated, his passing definitely declined,  but hopefully after essentially two years off of throwing the shoulder should be feeling good.


So the next point about Cam is his injury history. Cams injury history if he was on a team that people give a shit about would be a story of how we mismanaged his career. For his first six years Cam missed 5 starts. Those were from off the top of my head, a car wreck, an ankle injury, a concussion and hurt rib. The rib and ankle injury both occurred in the pocket. Cam has never really been hurt running the ball. He has learned to slide since pretty much his second season. 

Now onto how we mismanaged his injuries. In 2016 Cam partially tore his rotator cuff chasing an interception that Kelvin Benjamin gave up on(https://pantherswire.usatoday.com/2017/04/01/film-room-the-play-that-cam-newton-hurt-his-shoulder-on/).

The Panthers not only played Cam through a torn rotator cuff while statistically eliminated from the playoffs, they told him it would be fine with rehab and he didnt end up getting surgery until he got his own second opinion in March, which made him barely available for training camp. 

This should be an outrage to any football fan that such a truly unique talent got fucked over this harrd, but the story got essentially zero attention. 


So how do i think he will do for yall? I have legitimately no idea. But Cam at his height was a transcendant talent who played for lots of poor coaching staffs with poor rosters. Rivera hasnt done shit since Mcdermott left and the best WR we acquired during Cams tenure was Tedd Ginn. 

If Cam is truly healthy yall got an incredible player. The question is not about whether he is good though. Anyone who thinks Cam was bad didnt watch him win games with bums week in and week out.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

patriots,12,hhxd96,15,2020-06-29 04:21:30,4,1,"Jakob Johnson’s situation Hey guys, maybe this is not the right time to ask questions like this with all the Cam smoke going on right now but I thought I’d still ask:

As I am from Germany, I follow my fellow Germans on their road in the NFL. One of the players who surprised me the most, last season, was Jakob Johnson. When he came in to replace Develin when injured, he showed great flashes imo. Especially because not many people thought he would ever play a regular season game before.

So now that Develin retired, it looks like Johnson has got a even better chance of making the team this season but from what I’ve heard, the competition this year is even harder. 
With Vitale, there is a fullback with more experience, additionally the Patriots drafted two new Tight ends iirc, do you think one of them could compete for a spot as the fullback too or are they likely going to just compete for the tight end position?

Do you think Johnson has a legit chance of making the roster again?
Also, could he go on the practice squad (normal practice squad, not the pathway program slot) again, to be activated in case anything happens to another player?
Do you think another team would claim him if he got placed on the practice squad?

All in all, how likely do you think it is, that we will see Johnson on the field next season?


Sorry if that question is too casual to be posted in here.
I would really appreciate hearing about your opinions nevertheless!

If you do not change history, Brady and Belichick lose to the Giants, but they also go on to five more Super Bowls and three more championships.

As a female sports fan it can be incredibly frustrating and disheartening how the league (and other pro sports leagues for that matter) handle domestic violence issues and reported assault against women by players. 

Although he was a great player, I didn't want Antonio Brown on the Patriots because of his attitude issue and was happy when the Patriots dropped him as soon as his past domestic violence issues came to light. There were some rumors at the time that Tom Brady was unhappy that Brown was gone and that he potentially wanted to play elsewhere just to be with AB. 

I was really glad with how the majority of people on this sub felt about the issue. That they were even happy to see Tom go if he wanted to play with someone who had a history of sexual assault. It makes me happy to know that fans of the team care about something that others would see as a non-issue as it was unrelated to the game. So again, thanks for warming my heart a bit.

Let me know what you guys think! Let's start a debate!

&#x200B;

Jarrett Stidham:

Outlook:

For Jarrett Stidham, the upcoming 2020 NFL season will prove to be the most important stretch of football he will have ever played in. With the departure of Tom Brady, the greatest player to ever man the quarterback position, Stidham will have the keys to the team. With only one foreseeable backup in Brian Hoyer, Stidham should be the Patriots week one starter. While showing signs of promise during the preseason in which he threw for over 700 yards, 4 touchdowns and a QBR of 102.6, the Auburn product has yet to prove he can execute against starting caliber players. 

Prediction: 

The New England Patriots are giving Stidham the chance to prove he can be Tom Brady’s successor. While it’s far-fetched to believe he will rival the greatness that Brady’s tenure with the team produced, I have faith that Stidham will hold his own in year two. His ability to thread the needle (64% completion rate in college), low interception totals (13 in 37 total collegiate starts) and his ability to lead (Auburn team captain in 2018) should translate well to a team that is looking to replicate success in the wake of Brady’s departure.

If you think about it if the Patriots do bad everyone will say Bill was only a good coach bc he had Brady. If I was Bill I would tell everyone that I'm too sick to coach this season and I have to live in a hospital. 

Of the Patriots are actually good this season  while hes pretending to be sick then he can comeback next season. If they end up being bad then he will just retire so he wont look like a bad coach. If I was a coach I would tell everyone that I have a virus or I have the flu or nomonia or something.  

It's too risky for Bill to be a coach this year bc if the Patriots are bad everyone will blame Bill and say he needs Brady. I hope the Patriots are good but Bill should just fake being sick to save himself from all the hate the media will give him. Skip Bayless will make fun of him bill if  the Pat's are bad while hes coaching.

I went to and am a fan of the university of Miami, and y’all signed Jeff Thomas, a Miami receiver as an undrafted free agent.   The dude has loads of potential, he was mocked as a mid round prospect.  I suspect he went undrafted because he was kicked off the Miami team for forging high school transcripts.  He then transferred to Illinois, but never played a game there as he was he was allowed back to Miami after richt left our program.  

The dude was a four star prospect out of high school, but legit has 10 minute mixtapes of him only scoring touchdowns.  Miami was pretty bad while he was here, but he constantly showed up in big games.  We got bashed by LSU in an opener, and he pretty much torched them a couple of times and was our entire offense.  I suggest going and watch his highlights from that game, Miami in general, and high school.

I’m rooting for him in New England, I wouldn’t be surprised if he carves out a roster spot as a return man or even wide receiver.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Anyway, I was wondering if there's been any word on when the new season jerseys are shipping? I ordered one a couple months ago, and it was then listed as a pre-order for the 29/5/20: after that date came and went without any communications, I emailed the support team. They said they were awaiting stock from their suppliers, but noticeably did not provide any kind of ETA.

Anyone else having similar problems? Are there issues in the US?

I think the group has some potential with Edelman, Sanu, and Harry leading the way. Edelman will always be Edelman and sanu showed that he can be the wr2 or wr3 when he’s healthy (Ravens game). With a (hopefully) full training camp and everything, I’m feeling confident Harry can go for 6-8tds and 700-800 yds. There’s also potential with Meyers who showed some flashes during his rookie year esp during his preseason reps with stiddy which gives me hope he can improve his second year. Either Byrd or thomas should make the team and provide some burner speed as well. All these reasons give me hope that the pats receiving core will be better than people expect and be much better than last year.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

patriots,10,ha76ri,0,2020-06-16 10:22:34,10,1,"The Patriots Dynasty Podcast: 2001 Season This all started as a simple website. I came across [an infographic](https://np.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/2rj600/updated_belichicks_patriots_vs_the_nfl/) on here by /u/ec_508 outlining the Patriots records vs every other team in the Belichick era. I loved it, but wanted it to be sortable and filterable. So I made a simple webpage that allowed me to do that.

# The Patriots Dynasty Website
I wanted to be able to update that webpage, so I build a back end behind the page. I wanted to be able to easily add games as they happened so the numbers would stay up-to-date, so I updated the back end to allow me to add every game into it and have the graphic calculate the numbers automatically. You can still see that page [here](https://patriotsdynasty.info/team-records). And there's a version for [only Tom Brady games](https://patriotsdynasty.info/brady-records), too.

Things snowballed from there. I worked with /u/timnog to add the highlight gifs to the website, and I've created a [search engine](https://patriotsdynasty.info/search/gifs) to easily find the exact play(s) you're looking for. Together, we've managed to get highlights of every game going back to 2009, and every [Tom Brady TD pass](https://patriotsdynasty.info/tom-brady-td-passes) except for his 2006 season.

# The Patriots Dynasty Podcast
While I've been going back and capturing highlights, it occurred to me that there were a lot of Patriots games that I just didn't remember, but enjoyed rewatching as I was grabbing highlights from it. This dynasty has been going on for so long (almost 20 years at this point!) that there's no way to remember all the good (and some bad) that's happened over that time.

Which brings me to the podcast. I've convinced my brothers to go back and rewatch every game of the Patriots dynasty. And we're doing a podcast episode on each game. We've just finished the 2001 season (Super Bowl episodes released today!), so I thought it might be helpful to have a rundown of each one for those of you who may want to join us for specific games. 


## 2001 Super Bowl: Patriots vs Rams
### [Matt Chatham Interview](https://patriotsdynasty.info/node/719) 
(1:08:54)

Who better to talk about the Patriots first Super Bowl victory than with someone who was actually there? Join the Brown brothers as they try not to embarrass themselves while interviewing the podcast's most famous guest, former Patriot linebacker Matt Chatham.

### [Game Recap](https://patriotsdynasty.info/game/66) 
(1:43:06)

It's finally here! The big game in the Big Easy. Join the brothers as they talk about John Madden, the Super Bowl logos and some fun facts that you'd probably forgotten by now. It's Super Bowl 36, the introduction to a dynasty (right Ricky Proehl?).

## [2001 AFC Championship: Patriots @ Steelers](https://patriotsdynasty.info/game/65)
(2:09:00)

Our plucky underdogs travel to Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, PA to take on the 10-point favorite Steelers team. This game was many things, but nothing exemplified it more than the renaissance of Drew Bledsoe. Join the wine-addled brothers as they discuss the 2001 AFC Championship game.

Since this is a long one, we're gonna try some chapters. Hopefully they work like they're supposed to:

Week 16 was a bye week for the Pats, so we figured we'd do a bye week episode as well. In true Pats fashion, we look inwards at what we've done right (and mostly wrong). Followed by a deep dive of the talented but troubled Terry Glenn.

For those who want to do more reading on Glenn, here's the articles mentioned in the podcast:

patriots,31,h8y0tm,10,2020-06-14 11:36:03,11,1,"Predicting the jersey number for every new Patriot: 2020 edition I've always been irrationally interested in jersey numbers.

And since training camp has yet to start and it’s too early for definitive roster projections, let’s try to predict something else.

A couple of guidelines:

* I’m assuming no player currently on the roster changes his number.    
* I’m ignoring potential cuts for the moment, which will obviously add to the list of available numbers.    
* Aside from the Patriots’ retired numbers (and 56, which isn’t officially retired but is not even issued during the preseason), I’m making predictions as if the numbers 12 and 87 will not be handed out this year.    

Additionally, I posted an earlier version of this on [PatsPulpit](https://www.patspulpit.com/2020/5/1/21244888/predicting-the-jersey-number-of-every-new-patriot-2020-edition) and [PatsFootballFans](http://www.patsfootballfans.com/2020/05/03/predicting-the-jersey-number-for-every-new-patriot-2020-edition/), but then-speculative UDFA signings have been confirmed or debunked since then, and I've changed my mind on a few players.

Here goes.

**Veteran signings**

*Beau Allen, DL:* **94**    
Allen has worn 94 and 91 in his career, wearing the former for his first four years in the NFL. That number is available in New England.

*Damiere Byrd, WR:* **13**    
Both of Byrd’s previous numbers, 18 and 14, are currently occupied in Foxboro. Assuming Byrd wants a number in the 10s, only 13 and 19 are available. Since it’s been guessed that Byrd will fill Phillip Dorsett’s role with the Patriots, let’s give him Dorsett’s old number.

*Brandon Copeland, LB:* **52**    
Copeland has mostly worn 51 in the NFL, but as that’s currently Ja’Whaun Bentley’s number, let’s add one.

*Cody Davis, S:* **22**    
If rookies got to pick before veterans, I wouldn’t give Davis 22. But as the number was been opened up with the release of Obi Melifonwu, and Davis wore 22 during the last season-plus, he gets it.

*Brian Hoyer, QB:* **2**    
Hoyer has adopted 2 as his number of choice in the later years of his career, wearing it last preseason instead of the 8 he’d worn in his first stint with New England. He’ll probably take it again.

*Marqise Lee, WR:* **19**    
Lee wore 11 in Jacksonville, but he won’t be able to squirrel away that number here. But Lee wore 9 in college, and going with that digit in the ones place, 19 is available.

*Adrian Phillips, S:* **21**    
Phillips’ familiar 31 is worn by Jonathan Jones, but changing the tens digit, there’s an obvious choice available.

*Dan Vitale, FB:* **45**    
Vitale’s collegiate 40 is retired in New England, so he gets the number he wore as a Packer.

**Draft picks**

*Kyle Dugger, S:* **44**    
If not for veterans picking first, I’d have selected 22 for Dugger. As it is, I am now out of numbers in the 20s and 30s, leaving only a few 40s numbers to select from. Dugger’s college number was 2, and I already explained why I didn’t put 22 here. Since Malik Gant currently wears 42, let’s double 22 and go with 44, a good number for a hard-hitting safety.

*Josh Uche, LB:* **58**    
This is a tough one to choose. If Tashawn Bower (practice squad defensive lineman) weren’t still on the team, I’d have selected 96 easily, as Uche wore 6 at Michigan. I’d like 98, but linebackers don’t wear 90s numbers as much in today’s NFL. I also like 48, but the Patriots generally give their linebackers 50s numbers first. Therefore my selection is 58.

*Anfernee Jennings, LB:* **53**    
Jennings wore 33 in college. Going with the theme of “keep the ones digit if available and it looks good,” 53 is available.

*Devin Asiasi, TE:* **86**    
It’s always easy to predict these when the player’s college number is available. (Although not always correct… looking at you, Jarrett Stidham.)

*Dalton Keene, TE:* **48**    
I’m torn between 48 and 88 for Keene, for whom I can’t use the ones-digit trick. (Keene wore 29 as a Hokie, 49 belongs to Joe Cardona, and 89 is retired.) The reason I’m picking 48 is that Keene is expected to play more as an H-back tight end, and I generally think of 40s numbers for H-backs. (However, the Patriots did give TE/FB hybrid Andrew Beck the 86 jersey last preseason, so this rule is not absolute.)

*Justin Rohrwasser, K:* **6**    
As his college number 16 is worn by Jakobi Meyers, I used the ones-digit trick for Rohrwasser.

*Michael Onwenu, G:* **66**    
Onwenu’s 50 from Michigan is occupied, and there aren’t many OL options to choose from. I’ve picked 66 as it’s a very round-looking number for a mountainous guard.

*Justin Herron, T:* **75**    
College number.

*Cassh Maluia, LB:* **46**    
Also college number. (Though it’ll be unusual seeing 46 on a player who is neither a fullback nor wearing a neck roll.)

*Dustin Woodard, C:* **67**    
While centers are allowed to wear 50s numbers in the NFL, and Woodard wore 53 at Memphis, the Patriots almost always give their offensive linemen 60s and 70s numbers. I’ve already assigned 53 (though there will be some number doubling in the preseason), 63 is Yodny Cajuste’s, and 73 is retired. Since the Patriots more commonly assign 60s numbers to interior linemen, I’ve given Woodard the only 60s number left.

**Undrafted rookies**

*Rashod Berry, TE:* **43**    
Berry is more of a fullback-TE hybrid, but also played linebacker at Ohio State. With the possibility of playing on either side of the ball, he needs an unoccupied 40s number. 43 is the only one available, and fittingly, it fulfills the ones-digit trick (college number: 13).

*Myles Bryant, CB:* **9**    
At this point, all defensive back numbers are occupied, so I could either double or go with a single digit for the preseason. There aren't any solid options for doubling with a current Patriots running back, so he ends up with the digit most often issued by the team as a temporary camp number, worn by players from V’Angelo Bentley to Tarell Brown to Gunner Olszewski.

*Jake Burt, TE:* **84**    
College number.

*Nick Coe, DE:* **97**    
It was in trying to pick Coe’s number that I realized I’d have one number in the 70s or 90s unworn entirely and started wishing I’d given Uche 98 instead. But I’ve already made my picks, and Coe could either get 71 to match his collegiate ones digit (91 at Auburn) or go with a 90s number. I went with 97, as 1 and 7 are both angular.

*De’Jon Harris, LB:* **47**    
Had I given Uche 98, Harris would be my pick for 58, as he wore 8 at Arkansas. But as 90s linebackers are becoming rarer and there are only four possible 40s numbers to double, I chose to double the fullbacks (leaving Keene and Cardona alone) and give Harris 47.

*Will Hastings, WR:* **88**    
With only three 80s numbers left and zero in the 10s, one receiver will have to wear a single-digit number for the preseason. But as Hastings wore 33 in college, by completing the left-side curves to make the digits into 88, I had my pick.

*Brian Lewerke, QB:* **5**    
Lewerke’s college number, 14, is worn in New England, so I added the digits together to pick his number.

*Bill Murray, DL:* **72**    
Murray fell into the UDFA DL conundrum described above. He wore 95 in college, but I was out of 90s numbers (I assigned 98 below), leaving me 71, 72, and 77 to pick from. The Pats have given the middle number out more often, so it was the pick.

*Sean Riley, WR:* **1**    
Speedster Riley ends up the receiver with a single digit, and gets his college number for now.

*J’Mar Smith, QB:* **8**    
College number.

*J.J. Taylor, RB:* **21**    
Since all RB numbers are taken, Taylor doubles up with his college number.

*Kyahva Tezino, LB:* **45**    
Davis really did throw me off, as had I been able to give Dugger 22, Tezino could wear his college number 44. As it is, I moved him up one.

*Jeff Thomas, WR:* **81**    
Two proper WR numbers left. Thomas is already considered the UDFA with the highest chance to make the roster, and 81 has a better history as a number than 82, so he gets that.

*Courtney Wallace Jr., DL:* **98**    
Wallace, who wore 90 in college, gets the last round ones digit.

*Isaiah Zuber, WR:* **82**    
Rescued from the single digits, Zuber gets the last 80s number available.

I believe Butler was caught with a prostitute in his room by one of the Patriot Chaperones. This is the only theory that makes sense in why everyone is so quiet. The league, the coaching staff, the players, etc. If they speak up, you know the media will RUN with this story. Also, People will be investigated. Butler won't say a word, because he might get in trouble if he speaks up… It's just obvious that he knew, he fucked up really bad, when he was crying before the game. He knew there was no chance for him to play. I feel like he was caught, then the patriots reported it to the NFL, and I wouldn't be surprised if NFL told the Patriots to handle it behind closed doors and suspend him for the game. 

We all know Super Bowl is the busiest day for Prostitutes, and strippers tooo (wherever it's hosted) Warren Sapp was caught and arrested. Was fired from ESPN. If you go back to 1998 Super Bowl, Eugene Robinson ( Atlanta Falcons ) was caught and suspended indefinitely.

This is something I had been wanting to do for a while, so I'm glad they did it!

The headline result is down in the section called ""Return vs Capital"". Over the past 10 years the Pats rank 8th, getting 112% expected production. Over the past 5 years it's worse at 102% (15th), but still above expected. The real problem was the *disaster* of a draft in 2017, which is sitting at 60% and doubtful to improve much. That, of course, may have been improved by having a first-round pick, but maybe not (since this is relative to expectations and 1sts have higher expectations).

I think what colors people's opinions on Bill's drafting is explained by the first table, which shows much draft capital each team has had as a percentage of the total. NE is toward the bottom of the list, partly because of always having low draft picks, and partly because of tending to trade picks for veterans. It would be interesting to compare to the AV of a team's original picks and factor in pick-for-veteran swaps, but that starts to get really complicated.

It also looks like this methodology includes a player's whole career, so for earlier drafts a team could be getting credit for a player they let walk. It's possible that's pumping this up a bit given Bill's love of letting players walk, but it's hard to say without doing the analysis from scratch. Either way, the Pats are finding players that are better than they should be, given their draft capital.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

patriots,0,gzpka4,36,2020-06-09 09:41:15,9,1,"I think the Pats would be the best team to sign Kaepernick Relative to almost any other team in the League, I think the Patriots would provide the best environment for Kaepernick to both re-enter the League and to be successful. It would have to be for the veteran minimum and to compete against Stidham (and be kept as a backup if the team sticks with Stidham as the first option).

The main reason for this idea is that the Pats would be uniquely capable of withstanding the media flurry. (Antonio Brown last year; Tim Tebow in 2013). Being able to focus exclusively on football would be the only way to evaluate the skill Kaepernick still has. I'm skeptical he can play at the level of 2012-2013, but I also think the Patriots would be among the best to organize an offense to make him (or anyone) successful.

Personally: I wouldn't want Kaepernick on the team unless he were really good. I think the team would build itself better by sticking with its plan for Stidham, because of how extensive the changes required to get Stidham ready. However, if I found out that the Pats signed Kaep, I'd trust Bill knows something.

We're trying to get 32 players to fill up the entire league, as of posting this we have 28. Right now the Patriots are open, but we simulated a fantasy draft so the rosters are random and a little more balanced, meaning you won't have the Patriots IRL roster.

We literally just started preseason so now's the perfect time to jump in! We're hoping to build up a good group of guys that will hopefully keep this league going for a few in-game seasons.

We went into Week 1 of 2016 with the unproven Jimmy G as the starter, facing off against the Arizona Cardinals, who were coming off an NFC Championship appearance.

I know I’m not being revisionist here when I say that almost everyone had us losing, and that there was no way our team could beat a “SB contender.” Not to mention that it was a primetime game.

I’ll never forget that Jimmy G rainbow pass to Hogan for the TD, or the missed field goal at the end of the game that lost it for the Cards.

Obviously the Cardinals ended up being not that great and the 2016 Pats team was one of the best squads in our history, but at the moment of that game I truly felt like we had a major underdog win. I also feel like this game gave us a huge momentum swing that, even though we went through hardships during Brady’s suspension, allowed us to start 3-1 without the GOAT.

Alternatively, would anyone have Dropbox links or The Pirate Bay to them? I could only find the recent TV Broadcasts for the most recent 3 SBs on TPB.

Cole Phelps, until the big scandal, is the perfect description for the post war American society of the perfect guy. Profesionall, Young, Respectful to all people, races, religions, culture, well respected. As you can see its clear that both Belichick and Phelps have filled there roles in there society, industry and have made it to the top. It should also be noted that Bill Belichick's father, Steve Belichick was a WW2 Veteran, so was Cole Phelps in the LA Noire Universe. When Steve came back,he coached High School Football joined the police force and became a detective and rose to the top of the LAPD fast. When Cole Phelps came back he joined the police force and became a detective and rose to the top of the LAPD fast. Bill Belichick as we know is very serious and when he is on the sideline, in a press conference, with his players and other coaching staff, he is always all business no matter the game or moment and barley cracks a smile or laugh, however he has later on opened up more to the media even appearing in the selection for the NFL 100 team.Phelps is also extremely professional at work and barely talks about his private life until later on when he becomes more comfortable with his partners and other cops.  Back to the theory, I think that Bill may been raised by Cole Phelps in the LA Noire Universe as Bill would have adopted a lot of these traits from Cole.

patriots,8,gqknx1,25,2020-05-25 16:22:22,16,1,"Two Quick Thoughts: How Well Did the Defense Play in the 5 Losses & Speed at WR *\*ATTENTION: I LOVE TB, BUT THIS READ WILL SAY TOM BRADY THREW SOME INT'S, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE DEFENSE TO DO WORSE, AS A RESULT TO FIELD POSITIONING. THIS IS NOT BLAMING TOM BRADY, IT IS JUST STATING FACTS OF WHAT HAPPENED.\**

DEFENSE:

1st Loss Vs. Ravens (30 Points Allowed): Starting with a 17-0 Hole, the Defense looked very bad in the first two drives. Then the defense stopped them 2 times, allowed us to get back to 17-10. We also got a turnover, with a fumble recovery. Punt+Fumble+Punt. It was 17-13 and the offense was driving, looking like we would come back. Then, the offense let up a fumble return TD. 24-13, and the offense did nothing after that after Brady also threw a pick.

2nd Loss Vs. Texans (28 Points allowed): Our defense didn’t play great but also allowed the offense, who only scored 3 in the first half, to win. We allowed a TD a quarter, and the offense didn’t do anything till it was too late. Brady also threw an INT in this game as well.

3rd Loss Vs. Chiefs (23 Points allowed): I hate talking about this game because the bs ref ball, but the defense let the offense win, and they didn’t. They gave them the game-winning drive. Also, they got a TD but, ref ball. In the end we would’ve melted the clock and had only needed a field goal to tie, and gone to OT, or even get a TD. Brady also threw an INT in this game. The defense also got an FR & an INT.

4th Loss Vs. Dolphins (20 Points allowed): How just HOW, defense. DOLPHINS. But still, the defense but the offense in a situation to win, if TB didn’t throw a pick-six in the first quarter, we would’ve won 24-20.

5th Loss Vs. Titans (13 Points allowed): Tom Brady threw a pick this game, just to note, and the defense gave the offense plenty of opportunities. The defense shut down Ryan Tannehill to only 72 yards and also got an INT.

In most of the losses, the defense gave the offense a decent shot to win the game.

Speed at WR:

Just to note, we added some speed that we didn’t have in two players:

\-Jeff Thomas (4.45, plays faster, as it seems, on the field). I hope he makes the roster

\-Damiere Byrd (4.28). I hope he does make the roster as well because he is a blazing fast burner that can take to top off of defenses if used correctly, which I think BB would do.

One Question for Y'all: Beau Allen of Damon Harrison or Mike Daniels??

But first the winner of best hit: Brandon Browner – Ladarius Green https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QawL7E4wWjE



Most surprising addition: Michael Floyd making block on Dolphins to send Edelman to the endzone https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a6M6jgUWT8Q




The number two receptions that really stands out to me are Kenbrell's toe tap touchdown against the saints and Randy Moss' one hander over then-Jets Darrell’s Revis.




Randy Moss’ touchdown came in week 2 of the 2010 season. Ultimately the Patriots lost this game 14-28, but damn was that a beautiful snag! Moss ran a post route and managed to get enough separation from the man coverage expert for the reception. Moss went up and snagged the ball out of the year for an unbelievable one-handed touchdown.



https://youtu.be/ZLq3SWnhgUE





Kenbrell on the other hand won a game that really should have been lost. Both teams are 5-1 and there was only Patriots were down with the 2:00 warning going off. The ball is in their hands and after a succession of plays, vintage Brady slices and dices the Saints defense, and they are now at the 17 yard-line with :10 left on the clock. Kenbrell runs a route straight into the end zone and goes up to get the catch over Jabari Greer’s head. He was a 26 year-old rookie who managed to make the roster with a ton of hard work after having a bit of a colored past and going undrafted.

I was talking football with someone about liking Jamaal Adams and how Gallup/1st round pick is an absolute steal. Being a Pats fan who naturally hates all things Jets I SHOULD technically hate Jamal Adams but recognize how good he is and vouch for him so much. It shows how true something is when you go against your own natural bias to reach a conclusion. 

This reminded me of one of the biggest supporters of the Patriots in deflategate: former Dolphins O-line coach Jim Turner. He said according to basically his entire life he SHOULD hate the Patriots and want them to be caught cheating and believe they are cheaters but couldn't because he's dealt with Ted Wells before in bullygate so he understood. The interview is one of the most eye opening things that every NFL fan and really all the general public should listen to and understand who Ted Wells/Exponent are and what they do because it's way bigger than just football. Of course no one looks into it.  Funny enough Turner is now a coach with the Bengals.  

Anyways, now I noticed the link to the interview that was on soundcloud from ""Adam Schein's Mad Dog sports radio"" HAS BEEN REMOVED:

Does anyone have a copy of this interview or know where to find it? I figured I should bring it up in case people have never heard it because it really is a must listen.
